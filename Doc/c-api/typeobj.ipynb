    "Perhaps one of the most important structures of the Python object system\n",
    "is the structure that defines a new type: the :c`PyTypeObject`\n",
    "structure. Type objects can be handled using any of the :c`PyObject_\\*`\n",
    "or :c`PyType_\\*` functions, but do not offer much that's interesting to\n",
    "most Python applications. These objects are fundamental to how objects\n",
    "behave, so they are very important to the interpreter itself and to any\n",
    "extension module that implements new types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type objects are fairly large compared to most of the standard types.\n",
    "The reason for the size is that each type object stores a large number\n",
    "of values, mostly C function pointers, each of which implements a small\n",
    "part of the type's functionality. The fields of the type object are\n",
    "examined in detail in this section. The fields will be described in the\n",
    "order in which they occur in the structure.\n",
