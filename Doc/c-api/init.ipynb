    "## Thread State and the Global Interpreter Lock\n",
    "\n",
    "single: global interpreter lock single: interpreter lock single: lock,\n",
    "interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is not fully thread-safe. In order to support\n",
    "multi-threaded Python programs, there's a global lock, called the\n",
    "`global\n",
    "interpreter lock` or `GIL`, that must be held by the current thread\n",
    "before it can safely access Python objects. Without the lock, even the\n",
    "simplest operations could cause problems in a multi-threaded program:\n",
    "for example, when two threads simultaneously increment the reference\n",
    "count of the same object, the reference count could end up being\n",
    "incremented only once instead of twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: setswitchinterval() (in module sys)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the rule exists that only the thread that has acquired the\n",
    "`GIL` may operate on Python objects or call Python/C API functions. In\n",
    "order to emulate concurrency of execution, the interpreter regularly\n",
    "tries to switch threads (see `sys.setswitchinterval`). The lock is also\n",
    "released around potentially blocking I/O operations like reading or\n",
    "writing a file, so that other Python threads can run in the meantime.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: PyThreadState single: PyThreadState\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter keeps some thread-specific bookkeeping\n",
    "information inside a data structure called :c`PyThreadState`. There's\n",
    "also one global variable pointing to the current :c`PyThreadState`: it\n",
    "can be retrieved using :c`PyThreadState_Get`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Releasing the GIL from extension code\n",
    "\n",
    "Most extension code manipulating the `GIL` has the following simple\n",
    "structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "Save the thread state in a local variable.\n",
    "Release the global interpreter lock.\n",
    "... Do some blocking I/O operation ...\n",
    "Reacquire the global interpreter lock.\n",
    "Restore the thread state from the local variable.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is so common that a pair of macros exists to simplify it:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS\n",
    "... Do some blocking I/O operation ...\n",
    "Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "single: Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS single: Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS\n",
    "\n",
    "The :c`Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` macro opens a new block and declares a\n",
    "hidden local variable; the :c`Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS` macro closes the\n",
    "block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The block above expands to the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "PyThreadState *_save;\n",
    "\n",
    "_save = PyEval_SaveThread();\n",
    "... Do some blocking I/O operation ...\n",
    "PyEval_RestoreThread(_save);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "single: PyEval_RestoreThread() single: PyEval_SaveThread()\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how these functions work: the global interpreter lock is used to\n",
    "protect the pointer to the current thread state. When releasing the lock\n",
    "and saving the thread state, the current thread state pointer must be\n",
    "retrieved before the lock is released (since another thread could\n",
    "immediately acquire the lock and store its own thread state in the\n",
    "global variable). Conversely, when acquiring the lock and restoring the\n",
    "thread state, the lock must be acquired before storing the thread state\n",
    "pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling system I/O functions is the most common use case for releasing\n",
    "the GIL, but it can also be useful before calling long-running\n",
    "computations which don't need access to Python objects, such as\n",
    "compression or cryptographic functions operating over memory buffers.\n",
    "For example, the standard `zlib` and `hashlib` modules release the GIL\n",
    "when compressing or hashing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Python created threads\n",
    "\n",
    "When threads are created using the dedicated Python APIs (such as the\n",
    "`threading` module), a thread state is automatically associated to them\n",
    "and the code showed above is therefore correct. However, when threads\n",
    "are created from C (for example by a third-party library with its own\n",
    "thread management), they don't hold the GIL, nor is there a thread state\n",
    "structure for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to call Python code from these threads (often this will be\n",
    "part of a callback API provided by the aforementioned third-party\n",
    "library), you must first register these threads with the interpreter by\n",
    "creating a thread state data structure, then acquiring the GIL, and\n",
    "finally storing their thread state pointer, before you can start using\n",
    "the Python/C API. When you are done, you should reset the thread state\n",
    "pointer, release the GIL, and finally free the thread state data\n",
    "structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The :c`PyGILState_Ensure` and :c`PyGILState_Release` functions do all of\n",
    "the above automatically. The typical idiom for calling into Python from\n",
    "a C thread is:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "PyGILState_STATE gstate;\n",
    "gstate = PyGILState_Ensure();\n",
    "\n",
    "/* Perform Python actions here. */\n",
    "result = CallSomeFunction();\n",
    "/* evaluate result or handle exception */\n",
    "\n",
    "/* Release the thread. No Python API allowed beyond this point. */\n",
    "PyGILState_Release(gstate);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the :c`PyGILState_\\*` functions assume there is only one\n",
    "global interpreter (created automatically by :c`Py_Initialize`). Python\n",
    "supports the creation of additional interpreters (using\n",
    ":c`Py_NewInterpreter`), but mixing multiple interpreters and the\n",
    ":c`PyGILState_\\*` API is unsupported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cautions about fork()\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important thing to note about threads is their behaviour in the\n",
    "face of the C :c`fork` call. On most systems with :c`fork`, after a\n",
    "process forks only the thread that issued the fork will exist. This has\n",
    "a concrete impact both on how locks must be handled and on all stored\n",
    "state in CPython's runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that only the \"current\" thread remains means any locks held by\n",
    "other threads will never be released. Python solves this for `os.fork`\n",
    "by acquiring the locks it uses internally before the fork, and releasing\n",
    "them afterwards. In addition, it resets any `lock-objects` in the child.\n",
    "When extending or embedding Python, there is no way to inform Python of\n",
    "additional (non-Python) locks that need to be acquired before or reset\n",
    "after a fork. OS facilities such as :c`pthread_atfork` would need to be\n",
    "used to accomplish the same thing. Additionally, when extending or\n",
    "embedding Python, calling :c`fork` directly rather than through\n",
    "`os.fork` (and returning to or calling into Python) may result in a\n",
    "deadlock by one of Python's internal locks being held by a thread that\n",
    "is defunct after the fork. :c`PyOS_AfterFork_Child` tries to reset the\n",
    "necessary locks, but is not always able to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that all other threads go away also means that CPython's\n",
    "runtime state there must be cleaned up properly, which `os.fork` does.\n",
    "This means finalizing all other :c`PyThreadState` objects belonging to\n",
    "the current interpreter and all other :c`PyInterpreterState` objects.\n",
    "Due to this and the special nature of the\n",
    "`\"main\" interpreter <sub-interpreter-support>`, :c`fork` should only be\n",
    "called in that interpreter's \"main\" thread, where the CPython global\n",
    "runtime was originally initialized. The only exception is if :c`exec`\n",
    "will be called immediately after.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-level API\n",
