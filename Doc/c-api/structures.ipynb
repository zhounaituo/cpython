    "# Common Object Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a large number of structures which are used in the definition\n",

    "\n",
    "## Base object types and macros\n",
    "\n",
    "All Python objects ultimately share a small number of fields at the\n",
    "beginning of the object's representation in memory. These are\n",
    "represented by the :c`PyObject` and :c`PyVarObject` types, which are\n",
    "defined, in turn, by the expansions of some macros also used, whether\n",
    "directly or indirectly, in the definition of all other Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> All object types are extensions of this type. This is a type which\n",
    "> contains the information Python needs to treat a pointer to an object\n",
    "> as an object. In a normal \"release\" build, it contains only the\n",
    "> object's reference count and a pointer to the corresponding type\n",
    "> object. Nothing is actually declared to be a :c`PyObject`, but every\n",
    "> pointer to a Python object can be cast to a :c`PyObject*`. Access to\n",
    "> the members must be done by using the macros :c`Py_REFCNT` and\n",
    "> :c`Py_TYPE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is an extension of :c`PyObject` that adds the `ob_size` field.\n",
    "> This is only used for objects that have some notion of *length*. This\n",
    "> type does not often appear in the Python/C API. Access to the members\n",
    "> must be done by using the macros :c`Py_REFCNT`, :c`Py_TYPE`, and\n",
    "> :c`Py_SIZE`.\n",
