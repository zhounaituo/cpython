    "## Unicode Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the implementation of `393` in Python 3.3, Unicode objects\n",
    "internally use a variety of representations, in order to allow handling\n",
    "the complete range of Unicode characters while staying memory efficient.\n",
    "There are special cases for strings where all code points are below 128,\n",
    "256, or 65536; otherwise, code points must be below 1114112 (which is\n",
    "the full Unicode range).\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8 representation is created on demand and cached in the Unicode\n",
    "object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The :c`Py_UNICODE` representation has been removed since Python 3.12\n",
    "with deprecated APIs. See `623` for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unicode Type\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic Unicode object types used for the Unicode\n",
    "implementation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a typedef of :c`wchar_t`, which is a 16-bit type or 32-bit\n",
    "> type depending on the platform.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3 In previous versions, this was a 16-bit type or a 32-bit type\n",
    "> depending on whether you selected a \"narrow\" or \"wide\" Unicode version\n",
    "> of Python at build time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This instance of :c`PyTypeObject` represents the Python Unicode type.\n",
    "> It is exposed to Python code as `str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following APIs are C macros and static inlined functions for fast\n",
    "checks and access to internal read-only data of Unicode objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if the object *o* is a Unicode object or an instance of a\n",
    "> Unicode subtype. This function always succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if the object *o* is a Unicode object, but not an instance\n",
    "> of a subtype. This function always succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Returns `0`. This API is kept only for backward compatibility.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.10 This API does nothing since Python 3.12.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> Return one of the PyUnicode kind constants (see above) that indicate\n",
    "> how many bytes per character this Unicode object uses to store its\n",
    "> data. *o* has to be a Unicode object in the \"canonical\" representation\n",
    "> (not checked).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return a void pointer to the raw Unicode buffer. *o* has to be a\n",

    "> Read a character from a Unicode object *o*, which must be in the\n",

    "> 3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the maximum code point that is suitable for creating another\n",
    "> string based on *o*, which must be in the \"canonical\" representation.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> 3.3\n",

    "### Unicode Character Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode provides many different character properties. The most often\n",
    "needed ones are available through these macros which are mapped to C\n",
    "functions depending on the Python configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is a whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is a lowercase character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is an uppercase character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is a titlecase character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is a linebreak character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is a decimal character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is a digit character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is a numeric character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is an alphabetic\n",
    "> character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is an alphanumeric\n",
    "> character.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return `1` or `0` depending on whether *ch* is a printable character.\n",
    "> Nonprintable characters are those characters defined in the Unicode\n",
    "> character database as \"Other\" or \"Separator\", excepting the ASCII\n",
    "> space (0x20) which is considered printable. (Note that printable\n",
    "> characters in this context are those which should not be escaped when\n",
    "> `repr` is invoked on a string. It has no bearing on the handling of\n",
    "> strings written to `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These APIs can be used for fast direct character conversions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the character *ch* converted to lower case.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3 This function uses simple case mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the character *ch* converted to upper case.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3 This function uses simple case mappings.\n",

    "> Return the character *ch* converted to title case.\n",

    "> 3.3 This function uses simple case mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the character *ch* converted to a decimal positive integer.\n",
    "> Return `-1` if this is not possible. This function does not raise\n",
    "> exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the character *ch* converted to a single digit integer. Return\n",
    "> `-1` if this is not possible. This function does not raise exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the character *ch* converted to a double. Return `-1.0` if this\n",
    "> is not possible. This function does not raise exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These APIs can be used to work with surrogates:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Check if *ch* is a surrogate (`0xD800 <= ch <= 0xDFFF`).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Check if *ch* is a high surrogate (`0xD800 <= ch <= 0xDBFF`).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Check if *ch* is a low surrogate (`0xDC00 <= ch <= 0xDFFF`).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Join two surrogate characters and return a single :c`Py_UCS4` value.\n",
    "> *high* and *low* are respectively the leading and trailing surrogates\n",
    "> in a surrogate pair. *high* must be in the range \\[0xD800; 0xDBFF\\]\n",
    "> and *low* must be in the range \\[0xDC00; 0xDFFF\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and accessing Unicode strings\n",
    "\n",
    "To create Unicode objects and access their basic sequence properties,\n",
    "use these APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Create a new Unicode object. *maxchar* should be the true maximum code\n",

    "> rounded up to the nearest value in the sequence 127, 255, 65535,\n",
    "> 1114111.\n",
    ">\n",

    "> Create a Unicode object from the char buffer *u*. The bytes will be\n",

    "> of the data is not allowed.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function raises `SystemError` when:\n",
    ">\n",

    "\n",
    "> Take a C :c`printf`-style *format* string and a variable number of\n",
    "> arguments, calculate the size of the resulting Python Unicode string\n",
    "> and return a string with the values formatted into it. The variable\n",
    "> arguments must be C types and must correspond exactly to the format\n",
