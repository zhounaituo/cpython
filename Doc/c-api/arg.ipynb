    "\n",
    "These functions are useful when creating your own extensions functions\n",
    "and methods. Additional information and examples are available in\n",
    "`extending-index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three of these functions described, :c`PyArg_ParseTuple`,\n",
    ":c`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords`, and :c`PyArg_Parse`, all use *format\n",
    "strings* which are used to tell the function about the expected\n",
    "arguments. The format strings use the same syntax for each of these\n",
    "functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parsing arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "A format string consists of zero or more \"format units.\" A format unit\n",
    "describes one Python object; it is usually a single character or a\n",
    "parenthesized sequence of format units. With a few exceptions, a format\n",
    "unit that is not a parenthesized sequence normally corresponds to a\n",
    "single address argument to these functions. In the following\n",
    "description, the quoted form is the format unit; the entry in (round)\n",
    "parentheses is the Python object type that matches the format unit; and\n",
    "the entry in \\[square\\] brackets is the type of the C variable(s) whose\n",
    "address should be passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings and buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "These formats allow accessing an object as a contiguous chunk of memory.\n",
    "You don't have to provide raw storage for the returned unicode or bytes\n",
    "area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when a format sets a pointer to a buffer, the buffer is\n",
    "managed by the corresponding Python object, and the buffer shares the\n",
    "lifetime of this object. You won't have to release any memory yourself.\n",
    "The only exceptions are `es`, `es#`, `et` and `et#`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when a :c`Py_buffer` structure gets filled, the underlying\n",
    "buffer is locked so that the caller can subsequently use the buffer even\n",
    "inside a :c`Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` block without the risk of mutable\n",
    "data being resized or destroyed. As a result, **you have to call**\n",
    ":c`PyBuffer_Release` after you have finished processing the data (or in\n",
    "any early abort case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless otherwise stated, buffers are not NUL-terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some formats require a read-only `bytes-like object`, and set a pointer\n",
    "instead of a buffer structure. They work by checking that the object's\n",
    ":c`PyBufferProcs.bf_releasebuffer` field is `NULL`, which disallows\n",
    "mutable objects such as `bytearray`.\n",
