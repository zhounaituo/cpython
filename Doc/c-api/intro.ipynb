    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Application Programmer's Interface to Python gives C and C++\n",
    "programmers access to the Python interpreter at a variety of levels. The\n",
    "API is equally usable from C++, but for brevity it is generally referred\n",
    "to as the Python/C API. There are two fundamentally different reasons\n",
    "for using the Python/C API. The first reason is to write *extension\n",
    "modules* for specific purposes; these are C modules that extend the\n",
    "Python interpreter. This is probably the most common use. The second\n",
    "reason is to use Python as a component in a larger application; this\n",
    "technique is generally referred to as `embedding` Python in an\n",
    "application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing an extension module is a relatively well-understood process,\n",
    "where a \"cookbook\" approach works well. There are several tools that\n",
    "automate the process to some extent. While people have embedded Python\n",
    "in other applications since its early existence, the process of\n",
    "embedding Python is less straightforward than writing an extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many API functions are useful independent of whether you're embedding or\n",
    "extending Python; moreover, most applications that embed Python will\n",
    "need to provide a custom extension as well, so it's probably a good idea\n",
    "to become familiar with writing an extension before attempting to embed\n",
    "Python in a real application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding standards\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're writing C code for inclusion in CPython, you **must** follow\n",
    "the guidelines and standards defined in\n",
    "[PEP 7](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0007/ \"PEP 7\"). These\n",
    "guidelines apply regardless of the version of Python you are\n",
    "contributing to. Following these conventions is not necessary for your\n",
    "own third party extension modules, unless you eventually expect to\n",
    "contribute them to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Include Files\n",
    "\n",
    "All function, type and macro definitions needed to use the Python/C API\n",
    "are included in your code by the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN\n",
    "#include <Python.h>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies inclusion of the following standard headers: `<stdio.h>`,\n",
    "`<string.h>`, `<errno.h>`, `<limits.h>`, `<assert.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`\n",
    "(if available).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python may define some pre-processor definitions which affect the\n",
    "standard headers on some systems, you *must* include `Python.h` before\n",
    "any standard headers are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to always define `PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN` before including\n",
    "`Python.h`. See `arg-parsing` for a description of this macro.\n",
    "\n",
    "All user visible names defined by Python.h (except those defined by the\n",
    "included standard headers) have one of the prefixes `Py` or `_Py`. Names\n",
    "beginning with `_Py` are for internal use by the Python implementation\n",
    "and should not be used by extension writers. Structure member names do\n",
    "not have a reserved prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "User code should never define names that begin with `Py` or `_Py`. This\n",
    "confuses the reader, and jeopardizes the portability of the user code to\n",
    "future Python versions, which may define additional names beginning with\n",
    "one of these prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The header files are typically installed with Python. On Unix, these are\n",
    "located in the directories `{prefix}/include/pythonversion/` and\n",
    "`{exec_prefix}/include/pythonversion/`, where `prefix` and `exec_prefix`\n",
    "are defined by the corresponding parameters to Python's `configure`\n",
    "script and *version* is `'%d.%d' % sys.version_info[:2]`. On Windows,\n",
    "the headers are installed in `{prefix}/include`, where `prefix` is the\n",
    "installation directory specified to the installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To include the headers, place both directories (if different) on your\n",
    "compiler's search path for includes. Do *not* place the parent\n",
    "directories on the search path and then use\n",
    "`#include <pythonX.Y/Python.h>`; this will break on multi-platform\n",
    "builds since the platform independent headers under `prefix` include the\n",
    "platform specific headers from `exec_prefix`.\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ users should note that although the API is defined entirely using C,\n",
    "the header files properly declare the entry points to be `extern \"C\"`.\n",
    "As a result, there is no need to do anything special to use the API from\n",
    "C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful macros\n",
    "\n",
    "Several useful macros are defined in the Python header files. Many are\n",
    "defined closer to where they are useful (e.g. :c`Py_RETURN_NONE`).\n",
    "Others of a more general utility are defined here. This is not\n",
    "necessarily a complete listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the absolute value of `x`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ask the compiler to always inline a static inline function. The\n",
    "> compiler can ignore it and decides to not inline the function.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It can be used to inline performance critical static inline functions\n",
    "> when building Python in debug mode with function inlining disabled.\n",
    "> For example, MSC disables function inlining when building in debug\n",
    "> mode.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Marking blindly a static inline function with Py_ALWAYS_INLINE can\n",
    "> result in worse performances (due to increased code size for example).\n",
    "> The compiler is usually smarter than the developer for the\n",
    "> cost/benefit analysis.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If Python is `built in debug mode <debug-build>` (if the `Py_DEBUG`\n",
    "> macro is defined), the :c`Py_ALWAYS_INLINE` macro does nothing.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It must be specified before the function return type. Usage:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` c\n",
    "> static inline Py_ALWAYS_INLINE int random(void) { return 4; }\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.11\n",
    "\n",
    "> Argument must be a character or an integer in the range \\[-128, 127\\]\n",
    "> or \\[0, 255\\]. This macro returns `c` cast to an `unsigned char`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use this for deprecated declarations. The macro must be placed before\n",
    "> the symbol name.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Example:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` c\n",
    "> Py_DEPRECATED(3.8) PyAPI_FUNC(int) Py_OldFunction(void);\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.8 MSVC support was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Like `getenv(s)`, but returns `NULL` if `-E` was passed on the command\n",
    "> line (i.e. if `Py_IgnoreEnvironmentFlag` is set).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the maximum value between `x` and `y`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the size of a structure (`type`) `member` in bytes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.6\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the minimum value between `x` and `y`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "> Disable inlining on a function. For example, it reduces the C stack\n",
    "> consumption: useful on LTO+PGO builds which heavily inline code (see\n",
    "> `33720`).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Usage:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` c\n",
    "> Py_NO_INLINE static int random(void) { return 4; }\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.11\n",
    "\n",
    "> Convert `x` to a C string. E.g. `Py_STRINGIFY(123)` returns `\"123\"`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.4\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use this when you have a code path that cannot be reached by design.\n",
    "> For example, in the `default:` clause in a `switch` statement for\n",
    "> which all possible values are covered in `case` statements. Use this\n",
    "> in places where you might be tempted to put an `assert(0)` or\n",
    "> `abort()` call.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In release mode, the macro helps the compiler to optimize the code,\n",
    "> and avoids a warning about unreachable code. For example, the macro is\n",
    "> implemented with `__builtin_unreachable()` on GCC in release mode.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A use for `Py_UNREACHABLE()` is following a call a function that never\n",
    "> returns but that is not declared :c`_Py_NO_RETURN`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If a code path is very unlikely code but can be reached under\n",
    "> exceptional case, this macro must not be used. For example, under low\n",
    "> memory condition or if a system call returns a value out of the\n",
    "> expected range. In this case, it's better to report the error to the\n",
    "> caller. If the error cannot be reported to caller, :c`Py_FatalError`\n",
    "> can be used.\n",
    ">\n",

    "## Objects, Types and Reference Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "object: type\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python/C API functions have one or more arguments as well as a\n",
    "return value of type :c`PyObject*`. This type is a pointer to an opaque\n",
    "data type representing an arbitrary Python object. Since all Python\n",
    "object types are treated the same way by the Python language in most\n",
    "situations (e.g., assignments, scope rules, and argument passing), it is\n",
    "only fitting that they should be represented by a single C type. Almost\n",
    "all Python objects live on the heap: you never declare an automatic or\n",
    "static variable of type :c`PyObject`, only pointer variables of type\n",
    ":c`PyObject*` can be declared. The sole exception are the type objects;\n",
    "since these must never be deallocated, they are typically static\n",
    ":c`PyTypeObject` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Python objects (even Python integers) have a `type` and a\n",
    "`reference count`. An object's type determines what kind of object it is\n",
    "(e.g., an integer, a list, or a user-defined function; there are many\n",
    "more as explained in `types`). For each of the well-known types there is\n",
    "a macro to check whether an object is of that type; for instance,\n",
    "`PyList_Check(a)` is true if (and only if) the object pointed to by *a*\n",
    "is a Python list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference count is important because today's computers have a finite\n",
    "(and often severely limited) memory size; it counts how many different\n",
    "places there are that have a reference to an object. Such a place could\n",
    "be another object, or a global (or static) C variable, or a local\n",
    "variable in some C function. When an object's reference count becomes\n",
    "zero, the object is deallocated. If it contains references to other\n",
    "objects, their reference count is decremented. Those other objects may\n",
    "be deallocated in turn, if this decrement makes their reference count\n",
    "become zero, and so on. (There's an obvious problem with objects that\n",
    "reference each other here; for now, the solution is \"don't do that.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "single: Py_INCREF() single: Py_DECREF()\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference counts are always manipulated explicitly. The normal way is to\n",
    "use the macro :c`Py_INCREF` to increment an object's reference count by\n",
    "one, and :c`Py_DECREF` to decrement it by one. The :c`Py_DECREF` macro\n",
    "is considerably more complex than the incref one, since it must check\n",
    "whether the reference count becomes zero and then cause the object's\n",
    "deallocator to be called. The deallocator is a function pointer\n",
    "contained in the object's type structure. The type-specific deallocator\n",
    "takes care of decrementing the reference counts for other objects\n",
    "contained in the object if this is a compound object type, such as a\n",
    "list, as well as performing any additional finalization that's needed.\n",
    "There's no chance that the reference count can overflow; at least as\n",
    "many bits are used to hold the reference count as there are distinct\n",
    "memory locations in virtual memory (assuming\n",
    "`sizeof(Py_ssize_t) >= sizeof(void*)`). Thus, the reference count\n",
    "increment is a simple operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to increment an object's reference count for every\n",
    "local variable that contains a pointer to an object. In theory, the\n",
    "object's reference count goes up by one when the variable is made to\n",
    "point to it and it goes down by one when the variable goes out of scope.\n",
    "However, these two cancel each other out, so at the end the reference\n",
    "count hasn't changed. The only real reason to use the reference count is\n",
    "to prevent the object from being deallocated as long as our variable is\n",
    "pointing to it. If we know that there is at least one other reference to\n",
    "the object that lives at least as long as our variable, there is no need\n",
    "to increment the reference count temporarily. An important situation\n",
    "where this arises is in objects that are passed as arguments to C\n",
    "functions in an extension module that are called from Python; the call\n",
    "mechanism guarantees to hold a reference to every argument for the\n",
    "duration of the call.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a common pitfall is to extract an object from a list and hold\n",
    "on to it for a while without incrementing its reference count. Some\n",
    "other operation might conceivably remove the object from the list,\n",
    "decrementing its reference count and possibly deallocating it. The real\n",
    "danger is that innocent-looking operations may invoke arbitrary Python\n",
    "code which could do this; there is a code path which allows control to\n",
    "flow back to the user from a :c`Py_DECREF`, so almost any operation is\n",
    "potentially dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "A safe approach is to always use the generic operations (functions whose\n",
    "name begins with `PyObject_`, `PyNumber_`, `PySequence_` or\n",
    "`PyMapping_`). These operations always increment the reference count of\n",
    "the object they return. This leaves the caller with the responsibility\n",
    "to call :c`Py_DECREF` when they are done with the result; this soon\n",
    "becomes second nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reference Count Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference count behavior of functions in the Python/C API is best\n",
    "explained in terms of *ownership of references*. Ownership pertains to\n",
    "references, never to objects (objects are not owned: they are always\n",
    "shared). \"Owning a reference\" means being responsible for calling\n",
    "Py_DECREF on it when the reference is no longer needed. Ownership can\n",
    "also be transferred, meaning that the code that receives ownership of\n",
    "the reference then becomes responsible for eventually decref'ing it by\n",
    "calling :c`Py_DECREF` or :c`Py_XDECREF` when it's no longer needed---or\n",
    "passing on this responsibility (usually to its caller). When a function\n",
    "passes ownership of a reference on to its caller, the caller is said to\n",
    "receive a *new* reference. When no ownership is transferred, the caller\n",
    "is said to *borrow* the reference. Nothing needs to be done for a\n",
    "`borrowed reference`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, when a calling function passes in a reference to an object,\n",
    "there are two possibilities: the function *steals* a reference to the\n",
    "object, or it does not. *Stealing a reference* means that when you pass\n",
    "a reference to a function, that function assumes that it now owns that\n",
    "reference, and you are not responsible for it any longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: PyList_SetItem() single: PyTuple_SetItem()\n",
    "\n",
    "Few functions steal references; the two notable exceptions are\n",
    ":c`PyList_SetItem` and :c`PyTuple_SetItem`, which steal a reference to\n",
    "the item (but not to the tuple or list into which the item is put!).\n",
    "These functions were designed to steal a reference because of a common\n",
    "idiom for populating a tuple or list with newly created objects; for\n",
    "example, the code to create the tuple `(1, 2, \"three\")` could look like\n",
    "this (forgetting about error handling for the moment; a better way to\n",
    "code this is shown below):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "PyObject *t;\n",
    "\n",
    "t = PyTuple_New(3);\n",
    "PyTuple_SetItem(t, 0, PyLong_FromLong(1L));\n",
    "PyTuple_SetItem(t, 1, PyLong_FromLong(2L));\n",
    "PyTuple_SetItem(t, 2, PyUnicode_FromString(\"three\"));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, :c`PyLong_FromLong` returns a new reference which is immediately\n",
    "stolen by :c`PyTuple_SetItem`. When you want to keep using an object\n",
    "although the reference to it will be stolen, use :c`Py_INCREF` to grab\n",
    "another reference before calling the reference-stealing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidentally, :c`PyTuple_SetItem` is the *only* way to set tuple items;\n",
    ":c`PySequence_SetItem` and :c`PyObject_SetItem` refuse to do this since\n",
    "tuples are an immutable data type. You should only use\n",
    ":c`PyTuple_SetItem` for tuples that you are creating yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalent code for populating a list can be written using\n",
    ":c`PyList_New` and :c`PyList_SetItem`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practice, you will rarely use these ways of creating and\n",
    "populating a tuple or list. There's a generic function,\n",
    ":c`Py_BuildValue`, that can create most common objects from C values,\n",
    "directed by a `format string`. For example, the above two blocks of code\n",
    "could be replaced by the following (which also takes care of the error\n",
    "checking):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "PyObject *tuple, *list;\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple = Py_BuildValue(\"(iis)\", 1, 2, \"three\");\n",
    "list = Py_BuildValue(\"[iis]\", 1, 2, \"three\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is much more common to use :c`PyObject_SetItem` and friends with\n",
    "items whose references you are only borrowing, like arguments that were\n",
    "passed in to the function you are writing. In that case, their behaviour\n",
    "regarding reference counts is much saner, since you don't have to\n",
    "increment a reference count so you can give a reference away (\"have it\n",
    "be stolen\"). For example, this function sets all items of a list\n",
    "(actually, any mutable sequence) to a given item:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "int\n",
    "set_all(PyObject *target, PyObject *item)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    Py_ssize_t i, n;\n",
    "\n",
    "    n = PyObject_Length(target);\n",
    "    if (n < 0)\n",
    "        return -1;\n",
    "    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "        PyObject *index = PyLong_FromSsize_t(i);\n",
    "        if (!index)\n",
    "            return -1;\n",
    "        if (PyObject_SetItem(target, index, item) < 0) {\n",
    "            Py_DECREF(index);\n",
    "            return -1;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        Py_DECREF(index);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "single: set_all()\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is slightly different for function return values. While\n",
    "passing a reference to most functions does not change your ownership\n",
    "responsibilities for that reference, many functions that return a\n",
    "reference to an object give you ownership of the reference. The reason\n",
    "is simple: in many cases, the returned object is created on the fly, and\n",
    "the reference you get is the only reference to the object. Therefore,\n",
    "the generic functions that return object references, like\n",
    ":c`PyObject_GetItem` and :c`PySequence_GetItem`, always return a new\n",
    "reference (the caller becomes the owner of the reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that whether you own a reference returned by\n",
    "a function depends on which function you call only --- *the plumage*\n",
    "(the type of the object passed as an argument to the function) *doesn't\n",
    "enter into it!* Thus, if you extract an item from a list using\n",
    ":c`PyList_GetItem`, you don't own the reference --- but if you obtain\n",
    "the same item from the same list using :c`PySequence_GetItem` (which\n",
    "happens to take exactly the same arguments), you do own a reference to\n",
    "the returned object.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: PyList_GetItem() single: PySequence_GetItem()\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how you could write a function that computes the\n",
    "sum of the items in a list of integers; once using :c`PyList_GetItem`,\n",
    "and once using :c`PySequence_GetItem`. :\n",

    "or `-1`, depending on the function's return type. A few functions return\n",
