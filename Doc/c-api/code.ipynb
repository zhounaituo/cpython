    "Code objects are a low-level detail of the CPython implementation. Each\n",

    "into a function.\n",

    "> The C structure of the objects used to describe code objects. The\n",
    "> fields of this type are subject to change at any time.\n",

    "> This is an instance of :c`PyTypeObject` representing the Python `code`\n",
    "> type.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if *co* is a `code` object. This function always succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the number of free variables in *co*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return a new code object. If you need a dummy code object to create a\n",
    "> frame, use :c`PyCode_NewEmpty` instead. Calling :c`PyCode_New`\n",
    "> directly will bind you to a precise Python version since the\n",
    "> definition of the bytecode changes often. The many arguments of this\n",
    "> function are inter-dependent in complex ways, meaning that subtle\n",
    "> changes to values are likely to result in incorrect execution or VM\n",
    "> crashes. Use this function only with extreme care.\n",

    "> 3.11 Added `exceptiontable` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyCode_New`, but with an extra \"posonlyargcount\" for\n",
    "> positional-only arguments. The same caveats that apply to `PyCode_New`\n",
    "> also apply to this function.\n",

    "> Return a new empty code object with the specified filename, function\n",

    "> Return the line number of the instruction that occurs on or before\n",
    "> `byte_offset` and ends after it. If you just need the line number of a\n",
