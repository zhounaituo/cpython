    "### Single-phase initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The module initialization function may create and return the module\n",
    "object directly. This is referred to as \"single-phase initialization\",\n",
    "and uses one of the following two module creation functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Create a new module object, given the definition in *def*. This\n",
    "> behaves like :c`PyModule_Create2` with *module_api_version* set to\n",
    "> `PYTHON_API_VERSION`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Create a new module object, given the definition in *def*, assuming\n",
    "> the API version *module_api_version*. If that version does not match\n",
    "> the version of the running interpreter, a `RuntimeWarning` is emitted.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Most uses of this function should be using :c`PyModule_Create`\n",
    "> instead; only use this if you are sure you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before it is returned from in the initialization function, the resulting\n",
    "module object is typically populated using functions like\n",
    ":c`PyModule_AddObjectRef`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-phase initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate way to specify extensions is to request \"multi-phase\n",
    "initialization\". Extension modules created this way behave more like\n",
    "Python modules: the initialization is split between the *creation\n",
    "phase*, when the module object is created, and the *execution phase*,\n",
    "when it is populated. The distinction is similar to the :py`__new__` and\n",
    ":py`__init__` methods of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike modules created using single-phase initialization, these modules\n",
    "are not singletons: if the *sys.modules* entry is removed and the module\n",
    "is re-imported, a new module object is created, and the old module is\n",
    "subject to normal garbage collection -- as with Python modules. By\n",
    "default, multiple modules created from the same definition should be\n",
    "independent: changes to one should not affect the others. This means\n",
    "that all state should be specific to the module object (using e.g. using\n",
    ":c`PyModule_GetState`), or its contents (such as the module's `__dict__`\n",
    "or individual classes created with :c`PyType_FromSpec`).\n",
    "\n",
    "All modules created using multi-phase initialization are expected to\n",
    "support `sub-interpreters <sub-interpreter-support>`. Making sure\n",
    "multiple modules are independent is typically enough to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "To request multi-phase initialization, the initialization function\n",
    "(PyInit_modulename) returns a :c`PyModuleDef` instance with non-empty\n",
    ":c`~PyModuleDef.m_slots`. Before it is returned, the `PyModuleDef`\n",
    "instance must be initialized with the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ensures a module definition is a properly initialized Python object\n",

    ">\n",
    "> 3.5\n",

    "> as defined in\n",
    "> [PEP 451](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0451/ \"PEP 451\"), and the\n",
    "> module definition. It should return a new module object, or set an\n",
    "> error and return `NULL`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function should be kept minimal. In particular, it should not\n",
