    "Python's complex number objects are implemented as two distinct types\n",
    "when viewed from the C API: one is the Python object exposed to Python\n",
    "programs, and the other is a C structure which represents the actual\n",
    "complex number value. The API provides functions for working with both.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complex Numbers as C Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the functions which accept these structures as parameters and\n",
    "return them as results do so *by value* rather than dereferencing them\n",
    "through pointers. This is consistent throughout the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The C structure which corresponds to the value portion of a Python\n",
    "> complex number object. Most of the functions for dealing with complex\n",
    "> number objects use structures of this type as input or output values,\n",
    "> as appropriate. It is defined as:\n",
