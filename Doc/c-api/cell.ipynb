    "\"Cell\" objects are used to implement variables referenced by multiple\n",

    "value; the local variables of each stack frame that references the value\n",
    "contains a reference to the cells from outer scopes which also use that\n",
    "variable. When the value is accessed, the value contained in the cell is\n",
    "used instead of the cell object itself. This de-referencing of the cell\n",
    "object requires support from the generated byte-code; these are not\n",
