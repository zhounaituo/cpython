    "# Tuple Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "object: tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "> This subtype of :c`PyObject` represents a Python tuple object.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This instance of :c`PyTypeObject` represents the Python tuple type; it\n",
    "> is the same object as `tuple` in the Python layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if *p* is a tuple object or an instance of a subtype of\n",
    "> the tuple type. This function always succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if *p* is a tuple object, but not an instance of a subtype\n",
    "> of the tuple type. This function always succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return a new tuple object of size *len*, or `NULL` on failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return a new tuple object of size *n*, or `NULL` on failure. The tuple\n",
    "> values are initialized to the subsequent *n* C arguments pointing to\n",
    "> Python objects. `PyTuple_Pack(2, a, b)` is equivalent to\n",
    "> `Py_BuildValue(\"(OO)\", a, b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Take a pointer to a tuple object, and return the size of that tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the size of the tuple *p*, which must be non-`NULL` and point\n",
    "> to a tuple; no error checking is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the object at position *pos* in the tuple pointed to by *p*. If\n",
    "> *pos* is negative or out of bounds, return `NULL` and set an\n",
    "> `IndexError` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Like :c`PyTuple_GetItem`, but does no checking of its arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return the slice of the tuple pointed to by *p* between *low* and\n",
    "> *high*, or `NULL` on failure. This is the equivalent of the Python\n",
    "> expression `p[low:high]`. Indexing from the end of the list is not\n",
    "> supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Insert a reference to object *o* at position *pos* of the tuple\n",
    "> pointed to by *p*. Return `0` on success. If *pos* is out of bounds,\n",
    "> return `-1` and set an `IndexError` exception.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function \"steals\" a reference to *o* and discards a reference to\n",
    "> an item already in the tuple at the affected position.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Like :c`PyTuple_SetItem`, but does no error checking, and should\n",
    "> *only* be used to fill in brand new tuples.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function \"steals\" a reference to *o*, and, unlike\n",
    "> :c`PyTuple_SetItem`, does *not* discard a reference to any item that\n",
    "> is being replaced; any reference in the tuple at position *pos* will\n",
    "> be leaked.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can be used to resize a tuple. *newsize* will be the new length of the\n",
    "> tuple. Because tuples are *supposed* to be immutable, this should only\n",
    "> be used if there is only one reference to the object. Do *not* use\n",
    "> this if the tuple may already be known to some other part of the code.\n",
    "> The tuple will always grow or shrink at the end. Think of this as\n",
    "> destroying the old tuple and creating a new one, only more\n",
    "> efficiently. Returns `0` on success. Client code should never assume\n",
    "> that the resulting value of `*p` will be the same as before calling\n",
    "> this function. If the object referenced by `*p` is replaced, the\n",
    "> original `*p` is destroyed. On failure, returns `-1` and sets `*p` to\n",
    "> `NULL`, and raises `MemoryError` or `SystemError`.\n",

    "# Struct Sequence Objects\n",

    "Struct sequence objects are the C equivalent of\n",
