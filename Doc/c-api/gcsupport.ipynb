    "# Supporting Cyclic Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's support for detecting and collecting garbage which involves\n",
    "circular references requires support from object types which are\n",
    "\"containers\" for other objects which may also be containers. Types which\n",
    "do not store references to other objects, or which only store references\n",
    "to atomic types (such as numbers or strings), do not need to provide any\n",
    "explicit support for garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a container type, the :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_flags` field of the\n",
    "type object must include the `Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC` and provide an\n",
    "implementation of the :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` handler. If\n",
    "instances of the type are mutable, a :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_clear`\n",
    "implementation must also be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects with a type with this flag set must conform with the rules\n",
    "documented here. For convenience these objects will be referred to as\n",
    "container objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructors for container types must conform to two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The memory for the object must be allocated using\n",
    "    :c`PyObject_GC_New` or :c`PyObject_GC_NewVar`.\n",
    "2.  Once all the fields which may contain references to other containers\n",
    "    are initialized, it must call :c`PyObject_GC_Track`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the deallocator for the object must conform to a similar pair\n",
    "of rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Before fields which refer to other containers are invalidated,\n",
    "    :c`PyObject_GC_UnTrack` must be called.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The object's memory must be deallocated using :c`PyObject_GC_Del`.\n",

    "    Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a type adds the Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC, then it *must* implement at\n",

    "\n",
    "The :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` handler must have the following type:\n",

    "> Traversal function for a container object. Implementations must call\n",
    "> the *visit* function for each object directly contained by *self*,\n",
