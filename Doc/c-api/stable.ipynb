    "# C API Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's C API is covered by the Backwards Compatibility Policy, `387`.\n",
    "While the C API will change with every minor release (e.g. from 3.9 to\n",
    "3.10), most changes will be source-compatible, typically by only adding\n",
    "new API. Changing existing API or removing API is only done after a\n",
    "deprecation period or to fix serious issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython's Application Binary Interface (ABI) is forward- and\n",
    "backwards-compatible across a minor release (if these are compiled the\n",
    "same way; see `stable-abi-platform` below). So, code compiled for Python\n",
    "3.10.0 will work on 3.10.8 and vice versa, but will need to be compiled\n",
    "separately for 3.9.x and 3.10.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Names prefixed by an underscore, such as `_Py_InternalState`, are\n",
    "private API that can change without notice even in patch releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stable Application Binary Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.2 introduced the *Limited API*, a subset of Python's C API.\n",
    "Extensions that only use the Limited API can be compiled once and work\n",
    "with multiple versions of Python. Contents of the Limited API are\n",
    "`listed below <stable-abi-list>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this, Python provides a *Stable ABI*: a set of symbols that\n",
    "will remain compatible across Python 3.x versions. The Stable ABI\n",
    "contains symbols exposed in the Limited API, but also other ones – for\n",
    "example, functions necessary to support older versions of the Limited\n",
    "API.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For simplicity, this document talks about *extensions*, but the Limited\n",
    "API and Stable ABI work the same way for all uses of the API – for\n",
    "example, embedding Python.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Define this macro before including `Python.h` to opt in to only use\n",
    "> the Limited API, and to select the Limited API version.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Define `Py_LIMITED_API` to the value of :c`PY_VERSION_HEX`\n",
    "> corresponding to the lowest Python version your extension supports.\n",
    "> The extension will work without recompilation with all Python 3\n",
    "> releases from the specified one onward, and can use Limited API\n",
    "> introduced up to that version.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Rather than using the `PY_VERSION_HEX` macro directly, hardcode a\n",
    "> minimum minor version (e.g. `0x030A0000` for Python 3.10) for\n",
    "> stability when compiling with future Python versions.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can also define `Py_LIMITED_API` to `3`. This works the same as\n",
    "> `0x03020000` (Python 3.2, the version that introduced Limited API).\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, extensions that use the Stable ABI should be linked against\n",
    "`python3.dll` rather than a version-specific library such as\n",
    "`python39.dll`.\n",
    "\n",
    "On some platforms, Python will look for and load shared library files\n",
    "named with the `abi3` tag (e.g. `mymodule.abi3.so`). It does not check\n",
    "if such extensions conform to a Stable ABI. The user (or their packaging\n",
    "tools) need to ensure that, for example, extensions built with the 3.10+\n",
    "Limited API are not installed for lower versions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions in the Stable ABI are present as functions in Python's\n",
    "shared library, not solely as macros. This makes them usable from\n",
    "languages that don't use the C preprocessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited API Scope and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for the Limited API is to allow everything that is possible\n",
    "with the full C API, but possibly with a performance penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, while :c`PyList_GetItem` is available, its “unsafe” macro\n",
    "variant :c`PyList_GET_ITEM` is not. The macro can be faster because it\n",
    "can rely on version-specific implementation details of the list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `Py_LIMITED_API` defined, some C API functions are inlined or\n",
    "replaced by macros. Defining `Py_LIMITED_API` disables this inlining,\n",
    "allowing stability as Python's data structures are improved, but\n",
    "possibly reducing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leaving out the `Py_LIMITED_API` definition, it is possible to\n",
    "compile a Limited API extension with a version-specific ABI. This can\n",
    "improve performance for that Python version, but will limit\n",
    "compatibility. Compiling with `Py_LIMITED_API` will then yield an\n",
    "extension that can be distributed where a version-specific one is not\n",
    "available – for example, for prereleases of an upcoming Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limited API Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that compiling with `Py_LIMITED_API` is *not* a complete guarantee\n",
    "that code conforms to the Limited API or the Stable ABI.\n",
    "`Py_LIMITED_API` only covers definitions, but an API also includes other\n",
    "issues, such as expected semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue that `Py_LIMITED_API` does not guard against is calling a\n",
    "function with arguments that are invalid in a lower Python version. For\n",
    "example, consider a function that starts accepting `NULL` for an\n",
    "argument. In Python 3.9, `NULL` now selects a default behavior, but in\n",
    "Python 3.8, the argument will be used directly, causing a `NULL`\n",
    "dereference and crash. A similar argument works for fields of structs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is that some struct fields are currently not hidden when\n",
    "`Py_LIMITED_API` is defined, even though they're part of the Limited\n",
    "API.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, we recommend testing an extension with *all* minor\n",
    "Python versions it supports, and preferably to build with the *lowest*\n",
    "such version.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend reviewing documentation of all used API to check if it\n",
    "is explicitly part of the Limited API. Even with `Py_LIMITED_API`\n",
    "defined, a few private declarations are exposed for technical reasons\n",
    "(or even unintentionally, as bugs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the Limited API is not necessarily stable: compiling with\n",
    "`Py_LIMITED_API` with Python 3.8 means that the extension will run with\n",
    "Python 3.12, but it will not necessarily *compile* with Python 3.12. In\n",
    "particular, parts of the Limited API may be deprecated and removed,\n",
    "provided that the Stable ABI stays stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Platform Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "ABI stability depends not only on Python, but also on the compiler used,\n",
    "lower-level libraries and compiler options. For the purposes of the\n",
    "Stable ABI, these details define a “platform”. They usually depend on\n",
    "the OS type and processor architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the responsibility of each particular distributor of Python to\n",
    "ensure that all Python versions on a particular platform are built in a\n",
    "way that does not break the Stable ABI. This is the case with Windows\n",
    "and macOS releases from `python.org` and many third-party distributors.\n",
    "\n",
