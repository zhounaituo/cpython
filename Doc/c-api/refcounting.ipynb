    "# Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "The macros in this section are used for managing reference counts of\n",
    "Python objects.\n",

    "> Increment the reference count for object *o*.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function is usually used to convert a `borrowed reference` to a\n",
    "> `strong reference` in-place. The :c`Py_NewRef` function can be used to\n",
    "> create a new `strong reference`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The object must not be `NULL`; if you aren't sure that it isn't\n",
    "> `NULL`, use :c`Py_XINCREF`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Increment the reference count for object *o*. The object may be\n",
    "> `NULL`, in which case the macro has no effect.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> See also :c`Py_XNewRef`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Create a new `strong reference` to an object: increment the reference\n",
    "> count of the object *o* and return the object *o*.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When the `strong reference` is no longer needed, :c`Py_DECREF` should\n",
    "> be called on it to decrement the object reference count.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The object *o* must not be `NULL`; use :c`Py_XNewRef` if *o* can be\n",
    "> `NULL`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For example:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` c\n",
    "> Py_INCREF(obj);\n",
    "> self->attr = obj;\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> can be written as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` c\n",
    "> self->attr = Py_NewRef(obj);\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> See also :c`Py_INCREF`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`Py_NewRef`, but the object *o* can be NULL.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If the object *o* is `NULL`, the function just returns `NULL`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "> Decrement the reference count for object *o*.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If the reference count reaches zero, the object's type's deallocation\n",
    "> function (which must not be `NULL`) is invoked.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function is usually used to delete a `strong reference` before\n",
    "> exiting its scope.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The object must not be `NULL`; if you aren't sure that it isn't\n",
    "> `NULL`, use :c`Py_XDECREF`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Warning\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The deallocation function can cause arbitrary Python code to be\n",
    "> invoked (e.g. when a class instance with a `__del__` method is\n",
    "> deallocated). While exceptions in such code are not propagated, the\n",
    "> executed code has free access to all Python global variables. This\n",
    "> means that any object that is reachable from a global variable should\n",
    "> be in a consistent state before :c`Py_DECREF` is invoked. For example,\n",
    "> code to delete an object from a list should copy a reference to the\n",
    "> deleted object in a temporary variable, update the list data\n",
    "> structure, and then call :c`Py_DECREF` for the temporary variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Decrement the reference count for object *o*. The object may be\n",
    "> `NULL`, in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is\n",
    "> the same as for :c`Py_DECREF`, and the same warning applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Decrement the reference count for object *o*. The object may be\n",
    "> `NULL`, in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is\n",
    "> the same as for :c`Py_DECREF`, except that the argument is also set to\n",
    "> `NULL`. The warning for :c`Py_DECREF` does not apply with respect to\n",
    "> the object passed because the macro carefully uses a temporary\n",
    "> variable and sets the argument to `NULL` before decrementing its\n",
    "> reference count.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is a good idea to use this macro whenever decrementing the\n",
    "> reference count of an object that might be traversed during garbage\n",
