    "Certain objects available in Python wrap access to an underlying memory\n",
    "array or *buffer*. Such objects include the built-in `bytes` and\n",
    "`bytearray`, and some extension types like `array.array`. Third-party\n",
    "libraries may define their own types for special purposes, such as image\n",
    "processing or numeric analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "While each of these types have their own semantics, they share the\n",
    "common characteristic of being backed by a possibly large memory buffer.\n",
    "It is then desirable, in some situations, to access that buffer directly\n",
    "and without intermediate copying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides such a facility at the C level in the form of the\n",
    "`buffer\n",
    "protocol <bufferobjects>`. This protocol has two sides:\n",
    "\n",
    "single: PyBufferProcs\n",
    "\n",
    "-   on the producer side, a type can export a \"buffer interface\" which\n",
    "    allows objects of that type to expose information about their\n",
    "    underlying buffer. This interface is described in the section\n",
    "    `buffer-structs`;\n",
    "-   on the consumer side, several means are available to obtain a\n",
    "    pointer to the raw underlying data of an object (for example a\n",
    "    method parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple objects such as `bytes` and `bytearray` expose their underlying\n",
    "buffer in byte-oriented form. Other forms are possible; for example, the\n",
    "elements exposed by an `array.array` can be multi-byte values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example consumer of the buffer interface is the\n",
    "`~io.BufferedIOBase.write` method of file objects: any object that can\n",
    "export a series of bytes through the buffer interface can be written to\n",
    "a file. While `write` only needs read-only access to the internal\n",
    "contents of the object passed to it, other methods such as\n",
    "`~io.BufferedIOBase.readinto` need write access to the contents of their\n",
    "argument. The buffer interface allows objects to selectively allow or\n",
    "reject exporting of read-write and read-only buffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways for a consumer of the buffer interface to acquire a\n",
    "buffer over a target object:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   call :c`PyObject_GetBuffer` with the right parameters;\n",
    "-   call :c`PyArg_ParseTuple` (or one of its siblings) with one of the\n",
    "    `y*`, `w*` or `s*` `format codes <arg-parsing>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, :c`PyBuffer_Release` must be called when the buffer isn't\n",
    "needed anymore. Failure to do so could lead to various issues such as\n",
    "resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Buffer structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Buffer structures (or simply \"buffers\") are useful as a way to expose\n",
    "the binary data from another object to the Python programmer. They can\n",
    "also be used as a zero-copy slicing mechanism. Using their ability to\n",
    "reference a block of memory, it is possible to expose any data to the\n",
    "Python programmer quite easily. The memory could be a large, constant\n",
    "array in a C extension, it could be a raw block of memory for\n",
    "manipulation before passing to an operating system library, or it could\n",
    "be used to pass around structured data in its native, in-memory format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to most data types exposed by the Python interpreter, buffers\n",
    "are not :c`PyObject` pointers but rather simple C structures. This\n",
    "allows them to be created and copied very simply. When a generic wrapper\n",
    "around a buffer is needed, a `memoryview <memoryview-objects>` object\n",
    "can be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "For short instructions how to write an exporting object, see\n",
    "`Buffer Object Structures <buffer-structs>`. For obtaining a buffer, see\n",
