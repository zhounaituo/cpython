    "> function returns true for each pair in the dictionary, and false once\n",
    "> all pairs have been reported. The parameters *pkey* and *pvalue*\n",
    "> should either point to :c`PyObject*` variables that will be filled in\n",
    "> with each key and value, respectively, or may be `NULL`. Any\n",
    "> references returned through them are borrowed. *ppos* should not be\n",
    "> altered during iteration. Its value represents offsets within the\n",
    "> internal dictionary structure, and since the structure is sparse, the\n",
    "> offsets are not consecutive.\n",
