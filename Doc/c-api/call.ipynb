    "# Call Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython supports two different calling protocols: *tp_call* and\n",
    "vectorcall.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The *tp_call* Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of classes that set :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` are callable.\n",
    "The signature of the slot is:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "PyObject *tp_call(PyObject *callable, PyObject *args, PyObject *kwargs);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A call is made using a tuple for the positional arguments and a dict for\n",
    "the keyword arguments, similarly to `callable(*args, **kwargs)` in\n",
    "Python code. *args* must be non-NULL (use an empty tuple if there are no\n",
    "arguments) but *kwargs* may be *NULL* if there are no keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This convention is not only used by *tp_call*: :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_new`\n",
    "and :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_init` also pass arguments this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call an object, use :c`PyObject_Call` or another\n",
    "`call API <capi-call>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Vectorcall Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "3.9\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectorcall protocol was introduced in `590` as an additional\n",
    "protocol for making calls more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "As rule of thumb, CPython will prefer the vectorcall for internal calls\n",
    "if the callable supports it. However, this is not a hard rule.\n",
    "Additionally, some third-party extensions use *tp_call* directly (rather\n",
    "than using :c`PyObject_Call`). Therefore, a class supporting vectorcall\n",
    "must also implement :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_call`. Moreover, the callable\n",
    "must behave the same regardless of which protocol is used. The\n",
    "recommended way to achieve this is by setting :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_call`\n",
    "to :c`PyVectorcall_Call`. This bears repeating:\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "A class supporting vectorcall **must** also implement\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` with the same semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class should not implement vectorcall if that would be slower than\n",
    "*tp_call*. For example, if the callee needs to convert the arguments to\n",
    "an args tuple and kwargs dict anyway, then there is no point in\n",
    "implementing vectorcall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can implement the vectorcall protocol by enabling the\n",
    "`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL` flag and setting\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_vectorcall_offset` to the offset inside the object\n",
    "structure where a *vectorcallfunc* appears. This is a pointer to a\n",
    "function with the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *callable* is the object being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *args* is a C array consisting of the positional arguments followed by the  \n",
    "    values of the keyword arguments. This can be *NULL* if there are no\n",
    "    arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *nargsf* is the number of positional arguments plus possibly the  \n",
    "    `PY_VECTORCALL_ARGUMENTS_OFFSET` flag. To get the actual number of\n",
    "    positional arguments from *nargsf*, use :c`PyVectorcall_NARGS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *kwnames* is a tuple containing the names of the keyword arguments;  \n",
    "    in other words, the keys of the kwargs dict. These names must be\n",
    "    strings (instances of `str` or a subclass) and they must be unique.\n",
    "    If there are no keyword arguments, then *kwnames* can instead be\n",
    "    *NULL*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If this flag is set in a vectorcall *nargsf* argument, the callee is\n",
    "> allowed to temporarily change `args[-1]`. In other words, *args*\n",
    "> points to argument 1 (not 0) in the allocated vector. The callee must\n",
    "> restore the value of `args[-1]` before returning.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For :c`PyObject_VectorcallMethod`, this flag means instead that\n",
    "> `args[0]` may be changed.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Whenever they can do so cheaply (without additional allocation),\n",
    "> callers are encouraged to use `PY_VECTORCALL_ARGUMENTS_OFFSET`. Doing\n",
    "> so will allow callables such as bound methods to make their onward\n",
    "> calls (which include a prepended *self* argument) very efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call an object that implements vectorcall, use a\n",
    "`call API <capi-call>` function as with any other callable.\n",
    ":c`PyObject_Vectorcall` will usually be most efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "In CPython 3.8, the vectorcall API and related functions were available\n",
    "provisionally under names with a leading underscore:\n",
    "`_PyObject_Vectorcall`, `_Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL`,\n",
    "`_PyObject_VectorcallMethod`, `_PyVectorcall_Function`,\n",
    "`_PyObject_CallOneArg`, `_PyObject_CallMethodNoArgs`,\n",
    "`_PyObject_CallMethodOneArg`. Additionally, `PyObject_VectorcallDict`\n",
    "was available as `_PyObject_FastCallDict`. The old names are still\n",
    "defined as aliases of the new, non-underscored names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursion Control\n",
    "\n",
    "When using *tp_call*, callees do not need to worry about\n",
    "`recursion <recursion>`: CPython uses :c`Py_EnterRecursiveCall` and\n",
    ":c`Py_LeaveRecursiveCall` for calls made using *tp_call*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For efficiency, this is not the case for calls done using vectorcall:\n",
    "the callee should use *Py_EnterRecursiveCall* and\n",
