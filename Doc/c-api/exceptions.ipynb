    "# Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions described in this chapter will let you handle and raise\n",
    "Python exceptions. It is important to understand some of the basics of\n",
    "Python exception handling. It works somewhat like the POSIX :c`errno`\n",
    "variable: there is a global indicator (per thread) of the last error\n",
    "that occurred. Most C API functions don't clear this on success, but\n",
    "will set it to indicate the cause of the error on failure. Most C API\n",
    "functions also return an error indicator, usually `NULL` if they are\n",
    "supposed to return a pointer, or `-1` if they return an integer\n",
    "(exception: the :c`PyArg_\\*` functions return `1` for success and `0`\n",
    "for failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, the error indicator consists of three object pointers: the\n",
    "exception's type, the exception's value, and the traceback object. Any\n",
    "of those pointers can be `NULL` if non-set (although some combinations\n",
    "are forbidden, for example you can't have a non-`NULL` traceback if the\n",
    "exception type is `NULL`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function must fail because some function it called failed, it\n",
    "generally doesn't set the error indicator; the function it called\n",
    "already set it. It is responsible for either handling the error and\n",
    "clearing the exception or returning after cleaning up any resources it\n",
    "holds (such as object references or memory allocations); it should *not*\n",
    "continue normally if it is not prepared to handle the error. If\n",
    "returning due to an error, it is important to indicate to the caller\n",
    "that an error has been set. If the error is not handled or carefully\n",
    "propagated, additional calls into the Python/C API may not behave as\n",
    "intended and may fail in mysterious ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The error indicator is **not** the result of `sys.exc_info()`. The\n",
    "former corresponds to an exception that is not yet caught (and is\n",
    "therefore still propagating), while the latter returns an exception\n",
    "after it is caught (and has therefore stopped propagating).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Printing and clearing\n",
    "\n",
    "> Clear the error indicator. If the error indicator is not set, there is\n",
    "> no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Print a standard traceback to `sys.stderr` and clear the error\n",
    "> indicator. **Unless** the error is a `SystemExit`, in that case no\n",
    "> traceback is printed and the Python process will exit with the error\n",
    "> code specified by the `SystemExit` instance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Call this function **only** when the error indicator is set. Otherwise\n",
    "> it will cause a fatal error!\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If *set_sys_last_vars* is nonzero, the variables `sys.last_type`,\n",
    "> `sys.last_value` and `sys.last_traceback` will be set to the type,\n",
    "> value and traceback of the printed exception, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Alias for `PyErr_PrintEx(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Call `sys.unraisablehook` using the current exception and *obj*\n",
    "> argument.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This utility function prints a warning message to `sys.stderr` when an\n",
    "> exception has been set but it is impossible for the interpreter to\n",
    "> actually raise the exception. It is used, for example, when an\n",
    "> exception occurs in an `__del__` method.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The function is called with a single argument *obj* that identifies\n",
    "> the context in which the unraisable exception occurred. If possible,\n",
    "> the repr of *obj* will be printed in the warning message.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An exception must be set when calling this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raising exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions help you set the current thread's error indicator. For\n",
    "convenience, some of these functions will always return a `NULL` pointer\n",
    "for use in a `return` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is the most common way to set the error indicator. The first\n",
    "> argument specifies the exception type; it is normally one of the\n",
    "> standard exceptions, e.g. :c`PyExc_RuntimeError`. You need not\n",
    "> increment its reference count. The second argument is an error\n",
    "> message; it is decoded from `'utf-8'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This function is similar to :c`PyErr_SetString` but lets you specify\n",
    "> an arbitrary Python object for the \"value\" of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This function sets the error indicator and returns `NULL`. *exception*\n",
    "> should be a Python exception class. The *format* and subsequent\n",
    "> parameters help format the error message; they have the same meaning\n",
    "> and values as in :c`PyUnicode_FromFormat`. *format* is an\n",
    "> ASCII-encoded string.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Same as :c`PyErr_Format`, but taking a :c`va_list` argument rather\n",
    "> than a variable number of arguments.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.5\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a shorthand for `PyErr_SetObject(type, Py_None)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a shorthand for `PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError, message)`,\n",
    "> where *message* indicates that a built-in operation was invoked with\n",
    "> an illegal argument. It is mostly for internal use.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a shorthand for `PyErr_SetNone(PyExc_MemoryError)`; it returns\n",
    "> `NULL` so an object allocation function can write\n",
    "> `return PyErr_NoMemory();` when it runs out of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> single: strerror()\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This is a convenience function to raise an exception when a C library\n",
    "> function has returned an error and set the C variable :c`errno`. It\n",
    "> constructs a tuple object whose first item is the integer :c`errno`\n",
    "> value and whose second item is the corresponding error message (gotten\n",
    "> from :c`strerror`), and then calls `PyErr_SetObject(type, object)`. On\n",
    "> Unix, when the :c`errno` value is `EINTR`, indicating an interrupted\n",
    "> system call, this calls :c`PyErr_CheckSignals`, and if that set the\n",
    "> error indicator, leaves it set to that. The function always returns\n",
    "> `NULL`, so a wrapper function around a system call can write\n",
    "> `return PyErr_SetFromErrno(type);` when the system call returns an\n",
    "> error.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyErr_SetFromErrno`, with the additional behavior that\n",
    "> if *filenameObject* is not `NULL`, it is passed to the constructor of\n",
    "> *type* as a third parameter. In the case of `OSError` exception, this\n",
    "> is used to define the `filename` attribute of the exception instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObject`, but takes a\n",
    "> second filename object, for raising errors when a function that takes\n",
    "> two filenames fails.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.4\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObject`, but the filename\n",
    "> is given as a C string. *filename* is decoded from the `filesystem\n",
    "> encoding and error handler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a convenience function to raise `WindowsError`. If called with\n",
    "> *ierr* of :c`0`, the error code returned by a call to :c`GetLastError`\n",
    "> is used instead. It calls the Win32 function :c`FormatMessage` to\n",
    "> retrieve the Windows description of error code given by *ierr* or\n",
    "> :c`GetLastError`, then it constructs a tuple object whose first item\n",
    "> is the *ierr* value and whose second item is the corresponding error\n",
    "> message (gotten from :c`FormatMessage`), and then calls\n",
    "> `PyErr_SetObject(PyExc_WindowsError, object)`. This function always\n",
    "> returns `NULL`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyErr_SetFromWindowsErr`, with an additional parameter\n",
    "> specifying the exception type to be raised.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyErr_SetFromWindowsErrWithFilenameObject`, but the\n",
    "> filename is given as a C string. *filename* is decoded from the\n",
    "> filesystem encoding (`os.fsdecode`).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyErr_SetFromWindowsErrWithFilenameObject`, with an\n",
    "> additional parameter specifying the exception type to be raised.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyErr_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilenameObject`, but\n",
    "> accepts a second filename object.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Windows.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.4\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyErr_SetFromWindowsErrWithFilename`, with an additional\n",
    "> parameter specifying the exception type to be raised.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a convenience function to raise `ImportError`. *msg* will be\n",
    "> set as the exception's message string. *name* and *path*, both of\n",
    "> which can be `NULL`, will be set as the `ImportError`'s respective\n",
    "> `name` and `path` attributes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "> Much like :c`PyErr_SetImportError` but this function allows for\n",
    "> specifying a subclass of `ImportError` to raise.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.6\n",
    "\n",
    "> Set file, line, and offset information for the current exception. If\n",
    "> the current exception is not a `SyntaxError`, then it sets additional\n",
    "> attributes, which make the exception printing subsystem think the\n",
    "> exception is a `SyntaxError`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.4\n",
    "\n",
    "> Like :c`PyErr_SyntaxLocationObject`, but *filename* is a byte string\n",
    "> decoded from the `filesystem encoding and error handler`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3.2\n",
    "\n",
    "> Like :c`PyErr_SyntaxLocationEx`, but the *col_offset* parameter is\n",
    "> omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a shorthand for `PyErr_SetString(PyExc_SystemError, message)`,\n",
    "> where *message* indicates that an internal operation (e.g. a Python/C\n",
    "> API function) was invoked with an illegal argument. It is mostly for\n",
    "> internal use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issuing warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these functions to issue warnings from C code. They mirror similar\n",
    "functions exported by the Python `warnings` module. They normally print\n",
    "a warning message to *sys.stderr*; however, it is also possible that the\n",
    "user has specified that warnings are to be turned into errors, and in\n",
    "that case they will raise an exception. It is also possible that the\n",
    "functions raise an exception because of a problem with the warning\n",
    "machinery. The return value is `0` if no exception is raised, or `-1` if\n",
    "an exception is raised. (It is not possible to determine whether a\n",
    "warning message is actually printed, nor what the reason is for the\n",
    "exception; this is intentional.) If an exception is raised, the caller\n",
    "should do its normal exception handling (for example, :c`Py_DECREF`\n",
    "owned references and return an error value).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Issue a warning message. The *category* argument is a warning category\n",
    "> (see below) or `NULL`; the *message* argument is a UTF-8 encoded\n",
    "> string. *stack_level* is a positive number giving a number of stack\n",
    "> frames; the warning will be issued from the currently executing line\n",
    "> of code in that stack frame. A *stack_level* of 1 is the function\n",
    "> calling :c`PyErr_WarnEx`, 2 is the function above that, and so forth.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Warning categories must be subclasses of :c`PyExc_Warning`;\n",
    "> :c`PyExc_Warning` is a subclass of :c`PyExc_Exception`; the default\n",
    "> warning category is :c`PyExc_RuntimeWarning`. The standard Python\n",
    "> warning categories are available as global variables whose names are\n",
    "> enumerated at `standardwarningcategories`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For information about warning control, see the documentation for the\n",
    "> `warnings` module and the `-W` option in the command line\n",
    "> documentation. There is no C API for warning control.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Issue a warning message with explicit control over all warning\n",
    "> attributes. This is a straightforward wrapper around the Python\n",
    "> function `warnings.warn_explicit`; see there for more information. The\n",

    "> easily fail since the exception may be an instance instead of a class,\n",
    "> in the case of a class exception, or it may be a subclass of the\n",
    "> expected exception.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Equivalent to `PyErr_GivenExceptionMatches(PyErr_Occurred(), exc)`.\n",
    "> This should only be called when an exception is actually set; a memory\n",
    "> access violation will occur if no exception has been raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if the *given* exception matches the exception type in\n",

    "\n",
    "> Retrieve the error indicator into three variables whose addresses are\n",
    "> passed. If the error indicator is not set, set all three variables to\n",

    "> is already set, it is cleared first. If the objects are `NULL`, the\n",
    "> error indicator is cleared. Do not pass a `NULL` type and non-`NULL`\n",
    "> value or traceback. The exception type should be a class. Do not pass\n",
    "> an invalid exception type or value. (Violating these rules will cause\n",
    "> subtle problems later.) This call takes away a reference to each\n",
    "> object: you must own a reference to each object before the call and\n",
    "> after the call you no longer own these references. (If you don't\n",
    "> understand this, don't use this function. I warned you.)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function is normally only used by code that needs to save and\n",
    "> restore the error indicator temporarily. Use :c`PyErr_Fetch` to save\n",
    "> the current error indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Under certain circumstances, the values returned by :c`PyErr_Fetch`\n",
    "> below can be \"unnormalized\", meaning that `*exc` is a class object but\n",
    "> `*val` is not an instance of the same class. This function can be used\n",
    "> to instantiate the class in that case. If the values are already\n",
    "> normalized, nothing happens. The delayed normalization is implemented\n",
    "> to improve performance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function *does not* implicitly set the `__traceback__` attribute\n",
