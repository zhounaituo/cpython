    "# Weak Reference Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports *weak references* as first-class objects. There are two\n",
    "specific object types which directly implement weak references. The\n",
    "first is a simple reference object, and the second acts as a proxy for\n",
    "the original object as much as it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if *ob* is either a reference or proxy object. This\n",
    "> function always succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if *ob* is a reference object. This function always\n",
    "> succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return true if *ob* is a proxy object. This function always succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Return a weak reference object for the object *ob*. This will always\n",
    "> return a new reference, but is not guaranteed to create a new object;\n",
    "> an existing reference object may be returned. The second parameter,\n",
    "> *callback*, can be a callable object that receives notification when\n",
    "> *ob* is garbage collected; it should accept a single parameter, which\n",
    "> will be the weak reference object itself. *callback* may also be\n",
    "> `None` or `NULL`. If *ob* is not a weakly-referencable object, or if\n",
    "> *callback* is not callable, `None`, or `NULL`, this will return `NULL`\n",
    "> and raise `TypeError`.\n",

    "> Return a weak reference proxy object for the object *ob*. This will\n",

    "> Return the referenced object from a weak reference, *ref*. If the\n",
    "> referent is no longer live, returns `Py_None`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This function returns a `borrowed reference` to the referenced object.\n",
    "> This means that you should always call :c`Py_INCREF` on the object\n",
    "> except when it cannot be destroyed before the last usage of the\n",
    "> borrowed reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Similar to :c`PyWeakref_GetObject`, but does no error checking."
