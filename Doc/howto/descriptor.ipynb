    "`Descriptors <descriptor>` let objects customize attribute lookup,\n",
    "storage, and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide has four major sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The \"primer\" gives a basic overview, moving gently from simple\n",
    "    examples, adding one feature at a time. Start here if you're new to\n",
    "    descriptors.\n",
    "2.  The second section shows a complete, practical descriptor example.\n",
    "    If you already know the basics, start there.\n",
    "3.  The third section provides a more technical tutorial that goes into\n",
    "    the detailed mechanics of how descriptors work. Most people don't\n",
    "    need this level of detail.\n",
    "4.  The last section has pure Python equivalents for built-in\n",
    "    descriptors that are written in C. Read this if you're curious about\n",
    "    how functions turn into bound methods or about the implementation of\n",
    "    common tools like `classmethod`, `staticmethod`, `property`, and\n",
    "    `__slots__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this primer, we start with the most basic possible example and then\n",
    "we'll add new capabilities one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple example: A descriptor that returns a constant\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Ten` class is a descriptor whose `__get__` method always returns\n",
    "the constant `10`:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Ten:  \n",
    "def \\_\\_get\\_\\_(self, obj, objtype=None):  \n",
    "return 10\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the descriptor, it must be stored as a class variable in another\n",
    "class:\n",
    "\n",
    "class A:  \n",
    "x = 5 \\# Regular class attribute y = Ten() \\# Descriptor instance\n",
    "\n",
    "An interactive session shows the difference between normal attribute\n",
    "lookup and descriptor lookup:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> a = A() \\# Make an instance of class A \\>\\>\\> a.x \\# Normal\n",
    "attribute lookup 5 \\>\\>\\> a.y \\# Descriptor lookup 10\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `a.x` attribute lookup, the dot operator finds `'x': 5` in the\n",
    "class dictionary. In the `a.y` lookup, the dot operator finds a\n",
    "descriptor instance, recognized by its `__get__` method. Calling that\n",
    "method returns `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the value `10` is not stored in either the class dictionary or\n",
    "the instance dictionary. Instead, the value `10` is computed on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how a simple descriptor works, but it isn't very\n",
    "useful. For retrieving constants, normal attribute lookup would be\n",
    "better.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we'll create something more useful, a dynamic\n",
    "lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting descriptors typically run computations instead of returning\n",
    "constants:\n",
    "\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "class DirectorySize:\n",
    "\n",
    "> def \\_\\_get\\_\\_(self, obj, objtype=None):  \n",
    "> return len(os.listdir(obj.dirname))\n",
    "\n",
    "class Directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "> size = DirectorySize() \\# Descriptor instance\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, dirname):  \n",
    "> self.dirname = dirname \\# Regular instance attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "An interactive session shows that the lookup is dynamic â€” it computes\n",
    "different, updated answers each time:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> s = Directory('songs')\n",
    "    >>> g = Directory('games')\n",
    "    >>> s.size                              # The songs directory has twenty files\n",
    "    20\n",
    "    >>> g.size                              # The games directory has three files\n",
    "    3\n",
    "    >>> os.remove('games/chess')            # Delete a game\n",
    "    >>> g.size                              # File count is automatically updated\n",
    "    2\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides showing how descriptors can run computations, this example also\n",
    "reveals the purpose of the parameters to `__get__`. The *self* parameter\n",
    "is *size*, an instance of *DirectorySize*. The *obj* parameter is either\n",
    "*g* or *s*, an instance of *Directory*. It is the *obj* parameter that\n",
    "lets the `__get__` method learn the target directory. The *objtype*\n",
    "parameter is the class *Directory*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managed attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular use for descriptors is managing access to instance data. The\n",
    "descriptor is assigned to a public attribute in the class dictionary\n",
    "while the actual data is stored as a private attribute in the instance\n",
    "dictionary. The descriptor's `__get__` and `__set__` methods are\n",
    "triggered when the public attribute is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, *age* is the public attribute and *\\_age* is\n",
    "the private attribute. When the public attribute is accessed, the\n",
    "descriptor logs the lookup or update:\n",
    "\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",
    "\n",
    "class LoggedAgeAccess:\n",
    "\n",
    "> def \\_\\_get\\_\\_(self, obj, objtype=None):  \n",
    "> value = obj.\\_age logging.info('Accessing %r giving %r', 'age', value)\n",
    "> return value\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def \\_\\_set\\_\\_(self, obj, value):  \n",
    "> logging.info('Updating %r to %r', 'age', value) obj.\\_age = value\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "\n",
    "> age = LoggedAgeAccess() \\# Descriptor instance\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, name, age):  \n",
    "> self.name = name \\# Regular instance attribute self.age = age \\# Calls\n",
    "> \\_\\_set\\_\\_()\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def birthday(self):  \n",
    "> self.age += 1 \\# Calls both \\_\\_get\\_\\_() and \\_\\_set\\_\\_()\n",
    "\n",
    "An interactive session shows that all access to the managed attribute\n",
    "*age* is logged, but that the regular attribute *name* is not logged:\n",
    "\n",
    "import logging, sys logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,\n",
    "stream=sys.stdout, force=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> mary = Person('Mary M', 30) \\# The initial age update is logged\n",
    "<INFO:root:Updating> 'age' to 30 \\>\\>\\> dave = Person('David D', 40)\n",
    "<INFO:root:Updating> 'age' to 40\n",
    "\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> vars(mary) \\# The actual data is in a private attribute {'name':\n",
    "'Mary M', '\\_age': 30} \\>\\>\\> vars(dave) {'name': 'David D', '\\_age':\n",
    "40}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> mary.age \\# Access the data and log the lookup\n",
    "<INFO:root:Accessing> 'age' giving 30 30 \\>\\>\\> mary.birthday() \\#\n",
    "Updates are logged as well <INFO:root:Accessing> 'age' giving 30\n",
    "<INFO:root:Updating> 'age' to 31\n",
    "\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> dave.name \\# Regular attribute lookup isn't logged 'David D'\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> dave.age \\# Only the managed attribute is logged\n",
    "<INFO:root:Accessing> 'age' giving 40 40\n",
    "\n",
    "One major issue with this example is that the private name *\\_age* is\n",
    "hardwired in the *LoggedAgeAccess* class. That means that each instance\n",
    "can only have one logged attribute and that its name is unchangeable. In\n",
    "the next example, we'll fix that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customized names\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class uses descriptors, it can inform each descriptor about which\n",
    "variable name was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Person` class has two descriptor instances, *name*\n",
    "and *age*. When the `Person` class is defined, it makes a callback to\n",
    "`__set_name__` in *LoggedAccess* so that the field names can be\n",
    "recorded, giving each descriptor its own *public_name* and\n",
    "*private_name*:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Closing thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "A `descriptor` is what we call any object that defines `__get__`,\n",
    "`__set__`, or `__delete__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, descriptors can have a `__set_name__` method. This is only\n",
    "used in cases where a descriptor needs to know either the class where it\n",
    "was created or the name of class variable it was assigned to. (This\n",
    "method, if present, is called even if the class is not a descriptor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors get invoked by the dot operator during attribute lookup. If\n",
    "a descriptor is accessed indirectly with\n",
    "`vars(some_class)[descriptor_name]`, the descriptor instance is returned\n",
    "without invoking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors only work when used as class variables. When put in\n",
    "instances, they have no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main motivation for descriptors is to provide a hook allowing\n",
    "objects stored in class variables to control what happens during\n",
    "attribute lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the calling class controls what happens during lookup.\n",
    "Descriptors invert that relationship and allow the data being looked-up\n",
    "to have a say in the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors are used throughout the language. It is how functions turn\n",
    "into bound methods. Common tools like `classmethod`, `staticmethod`,\n",
    "`property`, and `functools.cached_property` are all implemented as\n",
    "descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complete Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a practical and powerful tool for locating\n",
    "notoriously hard to find data corruption bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validator class\n",
    "\n",
    "A validator is a descriptor for managed attribute access. Prior to\n",
    "storing any data, it verifies that the new value meets various type and\n",
    "range restrictions. If those restrictions aren't met, it raises an\n",
    "exception to prevent data corruption at its source.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `Validator` class is both an `abstract base class` and a managed\n",
    "attribute descriptor:\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Validator(ABC):\n",
    "\n",
    "> def \\_\\_set_name\\_\\_(self, owner, name):  \n",
    "> self.private_name = '\\_' + name\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def \\_\\_get\\_\\_(self, obj, objtype=None):  \n",
    "> return getattr(obj, self.private_name)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def \\_\\_set\\_\\_(self, obj, value):  \n",
    "> self.validate(value) setattr(obj, self.private_name, value)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> @abstractmethod def validate(self, value): pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom validators need to inherit from `Validator` and must supply a\n",
    "`validate` method to test various restrictions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom validators\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three practical data validation utilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `OneOf` verifies that a value is one of a restricted set of options.\n",
    "2.  `Number` verifies that a value is either an `int` or `float`.\n",
    "    Optionally, it verifies that a value is between a given minimum or\n",
    "    maximum.\n",
    "3.  `String` verifies that a value is a `str`. Optionally, it validates\n",
    "    a given minimum or maximum length. It can validate a user-defined\n",
    "    [predicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic))\n",

    "## Technical Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows is a more technical tutorial for the mechanics and details\n",
    "of how descriptors work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Defines descriptors, summarizes the protocol, and shows how descriptors\n",
    "are called. Provides an example showing how object relational mappings\n",
    "work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning about descriptors not only provides access to a larger toolset,\n",
    "it creates a deeper understanding of how Python works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition and introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a descriptor is an attribute value that has one of the\n",
    "methods in the descriptor protocol. Those methods are `__get__`,\n",
    "`__set__`, and `__delete__`. If any of those methods are defined for an\n",
    "attribute, it is said to be a `descriptor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete the\n",
    "attribute from an object's dictionary. For instance, `a.x` has a lookup\n",
    "chain starting with `a.__dict__['x']`, then `type(a).__dict__['x']`, and\n",
    "continuing through the method resolution order of `type(a)`. If the\n",
    "looked-up value is an object defining one of the descriptor methods,\n",
    "then Python may override the default behavior and invoke the descriptor\n",
    "method instead. Where this occurs in the precedence chain depends on\n",
    "which descriptor methods were defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors are a powerful, general purpose protocol. They are the\n",
    "mechanism behind properties, methods, static methods, class methods, and\n",
    "`super()`. They are used throughout Python itself. Descriptors simplify\n",
    "the underlying C code and offer a flexible set of new tools for everyday\n",
    "Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptor protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "`descr.__get__(self, obj, type=None) -> value`\n",
    "\n",
    "`descr.__set__(self, obj, value) -> None`\n",
    "\n",
    "`descr.__delete__(self, obj) -> None`\n",
    "\n",
    "That is all there is to it. Define any of these methods and an object is\n",
    "considered a descriptor and can override default behavior upon being\n",
    "looked up as an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an object defines `__set__` or `__delete__`, it is considered a data\n",
    "descriptor. Descriptors that only define `__get__` are called non-data\n",
    "descriptors (they are often used for methods but other uses are\n",
    "possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and non-data descriptors differ in how overrides are calculated\n",
    "with respect to entries in an instance's dictionary. If an instance's\n",
    "dictionary has an entry with the same name as a data descriptor, the\n",
    "data descriptor takes precedence. If an instance's dictionary has an\n",
    "entry with the same name as a non-data descriptor, the dictionary entry\n",
    "takes precedence.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Summary of invocation logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism for descriptors is embedded in the `__getattribute__()`\n",
    "methods for `object`, `type`, and `super`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important points to remember are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Descriptors are invoked by the `__getattribute__` method.\n",
    "-   Classes inherit this machinery from `object`, `type`, or `super`.\n",
    "-   Overriding `__getattribute__` prevents automatic descriptor calls\n",
    "    because all the descriptor logic is in that method.\n",
    "-   `object.__getattribute__` and `type.__getattribute__` make different\n",
    "    calls to `__get__`. The first includes the instance and may include\n",
    "    the class. The second puts in `None` for the instance and always\n",
    "    includes the class.\n",
    "-   Data descriptors always override instance dictionaries.\n",
    "-   Non-data descriptors may be overridden by instance dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic name notification\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is desirable for a descriptor to know what class variable\n",
    "name it was assigned to. When a new class is created, the `type`\n",
    "metaclass scans the dictionary of the new class. If any of the entries\n",
    "are descriptors and if they define `__set_name__`, that method is called\n",
    "with two arguments. The *owner* is the class where the descriptor is\n",
    "used, and the *name* is the class variable the descriptor was assigned\n",
    "to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation details are in :c`type_new()` and :c`set_names()` in\n",
    "`Objects/typeobject.c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the update logic is in `type.__new__`, notifications only take\n",
    "place at the time of class creation. If descriptors are added to the\n",
    "class afterwards, `__set_name__` will need to be called manually.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Non-data descriptors provide a simple mechanism for variations on the\n",
    "usual patterns of binding functions into methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, functions have a `__get__` method so that they can be\n",
    "converted to a method when accessed as attributes. The non-data\n",
    "descriptor transforms an `obj.f(*args)` call into `f(obj, *args)`.\n",
    "Calling `cls.f(*args)` becomes `f(*args)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart summarizes the binding and its two most useful variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "> | Transformation | Called from an object | Called from a class |\n",
    "> |----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "> | function       | f(obj, \\*args)        | f(\\*args)           |\n",
    "> | staticmethod   | f(\\*args)             | f(\\*args)           |\n",
    "> | classmethod    | f(type(obj), \\*args)  | f(cls, \\*args)      |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods return the underlying function without changes. Calling\n",
    "either `c.f` or `C.f` is the equivalent of a direct lookup into\n",
    "`object.__getattribute__(c, \"f\")` or `object.__getattribute__(C, \"f\")`.\n",
    "As a result, the function becomes identically accessible from either an\n",
    "object or a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good candidates for static methods are methods that do not reference the\n",
    "`self` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a statistics package may include a container class for\n",
    "experimental data. The class provides normal methods for computing the\n",
    "average, mean, median, and other descriptive statistics that depend on\n",
    "the data. However, there may be useful functions which are conceptually\n",
    "related but do not depend on the data. For instance, `erf(x)` is handy\n",
    "conversion routine that comes up in statistical work but does not\n",
    "directly depend on a particular dataset. It can be called either from an\n",
    "object or the class: `s.erf(1.5) --> .9332` or\n",
    "`Sample.erf(1.5) --> .9332`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since static methods return the underlying function with no changes, the\n",
    "example calls are unexciting:\n",
    "\n",
    "class E:  \n",
    "@staticmethod def f(x): return x \\* 10\n",
    "\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> E.f(3) 30 \\>\\>\\> E().f(3) 30\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the non-data descriptor protocol, a pure Python version of\n",
    "`staticmethod` would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "class StaticMethod:  \n",
    "\"Emulate PyStaticMethod_Type() in Objects/funcobject.c\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, f):  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Class methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike static methods, class methods prepend the class reference to the\n",
    "argument list before calling the function. This format is the same for\n",
    "whether the caller is an object or a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "class F:  \n",

    "\\>\\>\\> F.f(3) ('F', 3) \\>\\>\\> F().f(3) ('F', 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is useful whenever the method only needs to have a class\n",
    "reference and does not rely on data stored in a specific instance. One\n",
    "use for class methods is to create alternate class constructors. For\n",
    "example, the classmethod `dict.fromkeys` creates a new dictionary from a\n",
