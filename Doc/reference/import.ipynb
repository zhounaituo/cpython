    "# The import system\n",
    "\n",
    "single: import machinery\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code in one `module` gains access to the code in another module\n",
    "by the process of `importing` it. The `import` statement is the most\n",
    "common way of invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only way.\n",
    "Functions such as `importlib.import_module` and built-in `__import__`\n",
    "can also be used to invoke the import machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import` statement combines two operations; it searches for the\n",
    "named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the\n",
    "local scope. The search operation of the `!import` statement is defined\n",
    "as a call to the `__import__` function, with the appropriate arguments.\n",
    "The return value of `__import__` is used to perform the name binding\n",
    "operation of the `!import` statement. See the `!import` statement for\n",
    "the exact details of that name binding operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A direct call to `__import__` performs only the module search and, if\n",
    "found, the module creation operation. While certain side-effects may\n",
    "occur, such as the importing of parent packages, and the updating of\n",
    "various caches (including `sys.modules`), only the `import` statement\n",
    "performs a name binding operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an `import` statement is executed, the standard builtin\n",
    "`__import__` function is called. Other mechanisms for invoking the\n",
    "import system (such as `importlib.import_module`) may choose to bypass\n",
    "`__import__` and use their own solutions to implement import semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is first imported, Python searches for the module and if\n",
    "found, it creates a module object[1], initializing it. If the named\n",
    "module cannot be found, a `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised. Python\n",
    "implements various strategies to search for the named module when the\n",
    "import machinery is invoked. These strategies can be modified and\n",
    "extended by using various hooks described in the sections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 The import system has been updated to fully implement the second\n",
    "phase of `302`. There is no longer any implicit import machinery - the\n",
    "full import system is exposed through `sys.meta_path`. In addition,\n",
    "native namespace package support has been implemented (see `420`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## `importlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `importlib` module provides a rich API for interacting with the\n",
    "import system. For example `importlib.import_module` provides a\n",
    "recommended, simpler API than built-in `__import__` for invoking the\n",
    "import machinery. Refer to the `importlib` library documentation for\n",
    "additional detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "single: package\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has only one type of module object, and all modules are of this\n",
    "type, regardless of whether the module is implemented in Python, C, or\n",
    "something else. To help organize modules and provide a naming hierarchy,\n",
    "Python has a concept of `packages <package>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and\n",
    "modules as files within directories, but don't take this analogy too\n",
    "literally since packages and modules need not originate from the file\n",
    "system. For the purposes of this documentation, we'll use this\n",
    "convenient analogy of directories and files. Like file system\n",
    "directories, packages are organized hierarchically, and packages may\n",
    "themselves contain subpackages, as well as regular modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to keep in mind that all packages are modules, but not\n",
    "all modules are packages. Or put another way, packages are just a\n",
    "special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a\n",
    "`__path__` attribute is considered a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "All modules have a name. Subpackage names are separated from their\n",
    "parent package name by a dot, akin to Python's standard attribute access\n",
    "syntax. Thus you might have a package called `email`, which in turn has\n",
    "a subpackage called `email.mime` and a module within that subpackage\n",
    "called `email.mime.text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular packages\n",
    "\n",
    "pair: package; regular\n",
    "\n",
    "Python defines two types of packages, `regular packages <regular\n",
    "package>` and `namespace packages <namespace package>`. Regular packages\n",
    "are traditional packages as they existed in Python 3.2 and earlier. A\n",
    "regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an\n",
    "`__init__.py` file. When a regular package is imported, this\n",
    "`__init__.py` file is implicitly executed, and the objects it defines\n",
    "are bound to names in the package's namespace. The `__init__.py` file\n",
    "can contain the same Python code that any other module can contain, and\n",
    "Python will add some additional attributes to the module when it is\n",
    "imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following file system layout defines a top level\n",
    "`parent` package with three subpackages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parent/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        one/\n",
    "            __init__.py\n",
    "        two/\n",
    "            __init__.py\n",
    "        three/\n",
    "            __init__.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing `parent.one` will implicitly execute `parent/__init__.py` and\n",
    "`parent/one/__init__.py`. Subsequent imports of `parent.two` or\n",
    "`parent.three` will execute `parent/two/__init__.py` and\n",
    "`parent/three/__init__.py` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Namespace packages\n",
    "\n",
    "pair: package; namespace pair: package; portion\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace package is a composite of various `portions <portion>`,\n",
    "where each portion contributes a subpackage to the parent package.\n",
    "Portions may reside in different locations on the file system. Portions\n",
    "may also be found in zip files, on the network, or anywhere else that\n",
    "Python searches during import. Namespace packages may or may not\n",
    "correspond directly to objects on the file system; they may be virtual\n",
    "modules that have no concrete representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespace packages do not use an ordinary list for their `__path__`\n",
    "attribute. They instead use a custom iterable type which will\n",
    "automatically perform a new search for package portions on the next\n",
    "import attempt within that package if the path of their parent package\n",
    "(or `sys.path` for a top level package) changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With namespace packages, there is no `parent/__init__.py` file. In fact,\n",
    "there may be multiple `parent` directories found during import search,\n",
    "where each one is provided by a different portion. Thus `parent/one` may\n",
    "not be physically located next to `parent/two`. In this case, Python\n",
    "will create a namespace package for the top-level `parent` package\n",
    "whenever it or one of its subpackages is imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also `420` for the namespace package specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin the search, Python needs the `fully qualified <qualified name>`\n",
    "name of the module (or package, but for the purposes of this discussion,\n",
    "the difference is immaterial) being imported. This name may come from\n",
    "various arguments to the `import` statement, or from the parameters to\n",
    "the `importlib.import_module` or `__import__` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This name will be used in various phases of the import search, and it\n",
    "may be the dotted path to a submodule, e.g. `foo.bar.baz`. In this case,\n",
    "Python first tries to import `foo`, then `foo.bar`, and finally\n",
    "`foo.bar.baz`. If any of the intermediate imports fail, a\n",
    "`ModuleNotFoundError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The module cache\n",
    "\n",
    "single: sys.modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The first place checked during import search is `sys.modules`. This\n",
    "mapping serves as a cache of all modules that have been previously\n",
    "imported, including the intermediate paths. So if `foo.bar.baz` was\n",
    "previously imported, `sys.modules` will contain entries for `foo`,\n",
    "`foo.bar`, and `foo.bar.baz`. Each key will have as its value the\n",
    "corresponding module object.\n",
    "\n",
    "During import, the module name is looked up in `sys.modules` and if\n",
    "present, the associated value is the module satisfying the import, and\n",
    "the process completes. However, if the value is `None`, then a\n",
    "`ModuleNotFoundError` is raised. If the module name is missing, Python\n",
    "will continue searching for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sys.modules` is writable. Deleting a key may not destroy the associated\n",
    "module (as other modules may hold references to it), but it will\n",
    "invalidate the cache entry for the named module, causing Python to\n",
    "search anew for the named module upon its next import. The key can also\n",
    "be assigned to `None`, forcing the next import of the module to result\n",
    "in a `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beware though, as if you keep a reference to the module object,\n",
    "invalidate its cache entry in `sys.modules`, and then re-import the\n",
    "named module, the two module objects will *not* be the same. By\n",
    "contrast, `importlib.reload` will reuse the *same* module object, and\n",
    "simply reinitialise the module contents by rerunning the module's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finders and loaders\n",
    "\n",
    "single: finder single: loader single: module spec\n",
    "\n",
    "If the named module is not found in `sys.modules`, then Python's import\n",
    "protocol is invoked to find and load the module. This protocol consists\n",
    "of two conceptual objects, `finders <finder>` and `loaders <loader>`. A\n",
    "finder's job is to determine whether it can find the named module using\n",
    "whatever strategy it knows about. Objects that implement both of these\n",
    "interfaces are referred to as `importers <importer>` - they return\n",
    "themselves when they find that they can load the requested module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes a number of default finders and importers. The first one\n",
    "knows how to locate built-in modules, and the second knows how to locate\n",
    "frozen modules. A third default finder searches an `import path` for\n",
    "modules. The `import path` is a list of locations that may name file\n",
    "system paths or zip files. It can also be extended to search for any\n",
    "locatable resource, such as those identified by URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The import machinery is extensible, so new finders can be added to\n",
    "extend the range and scope of module searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finders do not actually load modules. If they can find the named module,\n",
    "they return a `module spec`, an encapsulation of the module's\n",
    "import-related information, which the import machinery then uses when\n",
    "loading the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections describe the protocol for finders and loaders in\n",
    "more detail, including how you can create and register new ones to\n",
    "extend the import machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 In previous versions of Python, finders returned `loaders <loader>`\n",
    "directly, whereas now they return module specs which *contain* loaders.\n",
    "Loaders are still used during import but have fewer responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "single: import hooks single: meta hooks single: path hooks pair: hooks;\n",
    "import pair: hooks; meta pair: hooks; path\n",
    "\n",
    "The import machinery is designed to be extensible; the primary mechanism\n",
    "for this are the *import hooks*. There are two types of import hooks:\n",
    "*meta hooks* and *import path hooks*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta hooks are called at the start of import processing, before any\n",
    "other import processing has occurred, other than `sys.modules` cache\n",
    "look up. This allows meta hooks to override `sys.path` processing,\n",
    "frozen modules, or even built-in modules. Meta hooks are registered by\n",
    "adding new finder objects to `sys.meta_path`, as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Import path hooks are called as part of `sys.path` (or\n",
    "`package.__path__`) processing, at the point where their associated path\n",
    "item is encountered. Import path hooks are registered by adding new\n",
    "callables to `sys.path_hooks` as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The meta path\n",
    "\n",
    "single: sys.meta_path pair: finder; find_spec\n",
    "\n",
    "When the named module is not found in `sys.modules`, Python next\n",
    "searches `sys.meta_path`, which contains a list of meta path finder\n",
    "objects. These finders are queried in order to see if they know how to\n",
    "handle the named module. Meta path finders must implement a method\n",
    "called `~importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec()` which takes three\n",
    "arguments: a name, an import path, and (optionally) a target module. The\n",
    "meta path finder can use any strategy it wants to determine whether it\n",
    "can handle the named module or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the meta path finder knows how to handle the named module, it returns\n",
    "a spec object. If it cannot handle the named module, it returns `None`.\n",
    "If `sys.meta_path` processing reaches the end of its list without\n",
    "returning a spec, then a `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised. Any other\n",
    "exceptions raised are simply propagated up, aborting the import process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `~importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec()` method of meta path\n",
    "finders is called with two or three arguments. The first is the fully\n",
    "qualified name of the module being imported, for example `foo.bar.baz`.\n",
    "The second argument is the path entries to use for the module search.\n",
    "For top-level modules, the second argument is `None`, but for submodules\n",
    "or subpackages, the second argument is the value of the parent package's\n",
    "`__path__` attribute. If the appropriate `__path__` attribute cannot be\n",
    "accessed, a `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised. The third argument is an\n",
    "existing module object that will be the target of loading later. The\n",
    "import system passes in a target module only during reload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meta path may be traversed multiple times for a single import\n",
    "request. For example, assuming none of the modules involved has already\n",
    "been cached, importing `foo.bar.baz` will first perform a top level\n",
    "import, calling `mpf.find_spec(\"foo\", None, None)` on each meta path\n",
    "finder (`mpf`). After `foo` has been imported, `foo.bar` will be\n",
    "imported by traversing the meta path a second time, calling\n",
    "`mpf.find_spec(\"foo.bar\", foo.__path__, None)`. Once `foo.bar` has been\n",
    "imported, the final traversal will call\n",
    "`mpf.find_spec(\"foo.bar.baz\", foo.bar.__path__, None)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some meta path finders only support top level imports. These importers\n",
    "will always return `None` when anything other than `None` is passed as\n",
    "the second argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's default `sys.meta_path` has three meta path finders, one that\n",
    "knows how to import built-in modules, one that knows how to import\n",
    "frozen modules, and one that knows how to import modules from an\n",
    "`import path` (i.e. the `path based finder`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 The `~importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec` method of meta path\n",
    "finders replaced `~importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_module`, which is\n",
    "now deprecated. While it will continue to work without change, the\n",
    "import machinery will try it only if the finder does not implement\n",
    "`find_spec()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 Use of `~importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_module` by the import\n",
    "system now raises `ImportWarning`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "If and when a module spec is found, the import machinery will use it\n",
    "(and the loader it contains) when loading the module. Here is an\n",
    "approximation of what happens during the loading portion of import:\n",
    "\n",
    "    module = None\n",
    "    if spec.loader is not None and hasattr(spec.loader, 'create_module'):\n",

    "        # Set __loader__ and __package__ if missing.\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        sys.modules[spec.name] = module\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            spec.loader.exec_module(module)\n",
    "        except BaseException:\n",

    "    return sys.modules[spec.name]\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "> -   If there is an existing module object with the given name in\n",
    ">     `sys.modules`, import will have already returned it.\n",
    "> -   The module will exist in `sys.modules` before the loader executes\n",
    ">     the module code. This is crucial because the module code may\n",
    ">     (directly or indirectly) import itself; adding it to `sys.modules`\n",
    ">     beforehand prevents unbounded recursion in the worst case and\n",
    ">     multiple loading in the best.\n",
    "> -   If loading fails, the failing module -- and only the failing\n",
    ">     module --gets removed from `sys.modules`. Any module already in\n",
    ">     the `sys.modules` cache, and any module that was successfully\n",
    ">     loaded as a side-effect, must remain in the cache. This contrasts\n",
    ">     with reloading where even the failing module is left in\n",
    ">     `sys.modules`.\n",
    "> -   After the module is created but before execution, the import\n",
    ">     machinery sets the import-related module attributes\n",
    ">     (\"\\_init_module_attrs\" in the pseudo-code example above), as\n",
    ">     summarized in a `later section <import-mod-attrs>`.\n",
    "> -   Module execution is the key moment of loading in which the\n",
    ">     module's namespace gets populated. Execution is entirely delegated\n",
    ">     to the loader, which gets to decide what gets populated and how.\n",
    "> -   The module created during loading and passed to exec_module() may\n",
    ">     not be the one returned at the end of import[2].\n",
    "\n",

    "loaders. These were previously performed by the\n",
    "`importlib.abc.Loader.load_module` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loaders\n",
    "\n",
    "Module loaders provide the critical function of loading: module\n",
    "execution. The import machinery calls the\n",
    "`importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module` method with a single argument, the\n",
    "module object to execute. Any value returned from\n",
    "`~importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module` is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loaders must satisfy the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "> -   If the module is a Python module (as opposed to a built-in module\n",
    ">     or a dynamically loaded extension), the loader should execute the\n",
    ">     module's code in the module's global name space\n",
    ">     (`module.__dict__`).\n",
    "> -   If the loader cannot execute the module, it should raise an\n",
    ">     `ImportError`, although any other exception raised during\n",
    ">     `~importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module` will be propagated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, the finder and loader can be the same object; in such\n",
    "cases the `~importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec` method would just\n",
    "return a spec with the loader set to `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module loaders may opt in to creating the module object during loading\n",
    "by implementing a `~importlib.abc.Loader.create_module` method. It takes\n",
    "one argument, the module spec, and returns the new module object to use\n",
    "during loading. `create_module()` does not need to set any attributes on\n",
    "the module object. If the method returns `None`, the import machinery\n",
    "will create the new module itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 The `~importlib.abc.Loader.create_module` method of loaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 The `~importlib.abc.Loader.load_module` method was replaced by\n",
    "`~importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module` and the import machinery assumed all\n",

    "For compatibility with existing loaders, the import machinery will use\n",
    "the `load_module()` method of loaders if it exists and the loader does\n",
    "not also implement `exec_module()`. However, `load_module()` has been\n",
    "deprecated and loaders should implement `exec_module()` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `load_module()` method must implement all the boilerplate loading\n",
    "functionality described above in addition to executing the module. All\n",
    "the same constraints apply, with some additional clarification:\n",
    "\n",
    "> -   If there is an existing module object with the given name in\n",
    ">     `sys.modules`, the loader must use that existing module.\n",
    ">     (Otherwise, `importlib.reload` will not work correctly.) If the\n",
    ">     named module does not exist in `sys.modules`, the loader must\n",
    ">     create a new module object and add it to `sys.modules`.\n",
    "> -   The module *must* exist in `sys.modules` before the loader\n",
    ">     executes the module code, to prevent unbounded recursion or\n",
    ">     multiple loading.\n",
    "> -   If loading fails, the loader must remove any modules it has\n",
    ">     inserted into `sys.modules`, but it must remove **only** the\n",

    "\n",
    "Before Python loads cached bytecode from a `.pyc` file, it checks\n",

    "\n",
    "The path based finder provides additional hooks and protocols so that\n",
    "you can extend and customize the types of searchable path entries. For\n",
    "example, if you wanted to support path entries as network URLs, you\n",

    "*finder*, distinguishing between them by using the terms\n",
    "`meta path finder` and `path entry finder`. These two types of finders\n",
    "are very similar, support similar protocols, and function in similar\n",

    "\n",
    "`420` introduced `namespace packages <namespace package>` for Python\n",

    "`366` describes the addition of the `__package__` attribute for explicit\n",
    "relative imports in main modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "`328` introduced absolute and explicit relative imports and initially\n",
    "proposed `__name__` for semantics `366` would eventually specify for\n",

    "`451` adds the encapsulation of per-module import state in spec objects.\n",
