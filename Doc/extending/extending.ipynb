    "# Extending Python with C or C++\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite easy to add new built-in modules to Python, if you know how\n",
    "to program in C. Such `extension modules` can do two things that can't\n",
    "be done directly in Python: they can implement new built-in object\n",
    "types, and they can call C library functions and system calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support extensions, the Python API (Application Programmers\n",
    "Interface) defines a set of functions, macros and variables that provide\n",
    "access to most aspects of the Python run-time system. The Python API is\n",
    "incorporated in a C source file by including the header `\"Python.h\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compilation of an extension module depends on its intended use as\n",
    "well as on your system setup; details are given in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The C extension interface is specific to CPython, and extension modules\n",
    "do not work on other Python implementations. In many cases, it is\n",
    "possible to avoid writing C extensions and preserve portability to other\n",
    "implementations. For example, if your use case is calling C library\n",
    "functions or system calls, you should consider using the `ctypes` module\n",
    "or the [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/) library rather than writing\n",
    "custom C code. These modules let you write Python code to interface with\n",
    "C code and are more portable between implementations of Python than\n",
    "writing and compiling a C extension module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create an extension module called `spam` (the favorite food of\n",
    "Monty Python fans...) and let's say we want to create a Python interface\n",
    "to the C library function :c`system`[1]. This function takes a\n",
    "null-terminated character string as argument and returns an integer. We\n",
    "want this function to be callable from Python as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` pycon\n",
    ">>> import spam\n",
    ">>> status = spam.system(\"ls -l\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by creating a file `spammodule.c`. (Historically, if a module is\n",
    "called `spam`, the C file containing its implementation is called\n",
    "`spammodule.c`; if the module name is very long, like `spammify`, the\n",
    "module name can be just `spammify.c`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two lines of our file can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN\n",
    "#include <Python.h>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which pulls in the Python API (you can add a comment describing the\n",
    "purpose of the module and a copyright notice if you like).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python may define some pre-processor definitions which affect the\n",
    "standard headers on some systems, you *must* include `Python.h` before\n",
    "any standard headers are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to always define `PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN` before including\n",
    "`Python.h`. See `parsetuple` for a description of this macro.\n",
    "\n",
    "All user-visible symbols defined by `Python.h` have a prefix of `Py` or\n",
    "`PY`, except those defined in standard header files. For convenience,\n",
    "and since they are used extensively by the Python interpreter,\n",
    "`\"Python.h\"` includes a few standard header files: `<stdio.h>`,\n",
    "`<string.h>`, `<errno.h>`, and `<stdlib.h>`. If the latter header file\n",
    "does not exist on your system, it declares the functions :c`malloc`,\n",
    ":c`free` and :c`realloc` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing we add to our module file is the C function that will be\n",
    "called when the Python expression `spam.system(string)` is evaluated\n",
    "(we'll see shortly how it ends up being called):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "static PyObject *\n",
    "spam_system(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    const char *command;\n",
    "    int sts;\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, \"s\", &command))\n",
    "        return NULL;\n",
    "    sts = system(command);\n",
    "    return PyLong_FromLong(sts);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a straightforward translation from the argument list in Python\n",
    "(for example, the single expression `\"ls -l\"`) to the arguments passed\n",
    "to the C function. The C function always has two arguments,\n",
    "conventionally named *self* and *args*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *self* argument points to the module object for module-level\n",
    "functions; for a method it would point to the object instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *args* argument will be a pointer to a Python tuple object\n",
    "containing the arguments. Each item of the tuple corresponds to an\n",
    "argument in the call's argument list. The arguments are Python objects\n",
    "--- in order to do anything with them in our C function we have to\n",
    "convert them to C values. The function :c`PyArg_ParseTuple` in the\n",
    "Python API checks the argument types and converts them to C values. It\n",
    "uses a template string to determine the required types of the arguments\n",
    "as well as the types of the C variables into which to store the\n",
    "converted values. More about this later.\n",
    "\n",
    ":c`PyArg_ParseTuple` returns true (nonzero) if all arguments have the\n",
    "right type and its components have been stored in the variables whose\n",
    "addresses are passed. It returns false (zero) if an invalid argument\n",
    "list was passed. In the latter case it also raises an appropriate\n",
    "exception so the calling function can return `NULL` immediately (as we\n",
    "saw in the example).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intermezzo: Errors and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "An important convention throughout the Python interpreter is the\n",
    "following: when a function fails, it should set an exception condition\n",
    "and return an error value (usually `-1` or a `NULL` pointer). Exception\n",
    "information is stored in three members of the interpreter's thread\n",
    "state. These are `NULL` if there is no exception. Otherwise they are the\n",
    "C equivalents of the members of the Python tuple returned by\n",
    "`sys.exc_info`. These are the exception type, exception instance, and a\n",
    "traceback object. It is important to know about them to understand how\n",
    "errors are passed around.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python API defines a number of functions to set various types of\n",
    "exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common one is :c`PyErr_SetString`. Its arguments are an\n",
    "exception object and a C string. The exception object is usually a\n",
    "predefined object like :c`PyExc_ZeroDivisionError`. The C string\n",
    "indicates the cause of the error and is converted to a Python string\n",
    "object and stored as the \"associated value\" of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful function is :c`PyErr_SetFromErrno`, which only takes an\n",
    "exception argument and constructs the associated value by inspection of\n",
    "the global variable :c`errno`. The most general function is\n",
    ":c`PyErr_SetObject`, which takes two object arguments, the exception and\n",
    "its associated value. You don't need to :c`Py_INCREF` the objects passed\n",
    "to any of these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can test non-destructively whether an exception has been set with\n",
    ":c`PyErr_Occurred`. This returns the current exception object, or `NULL`\n",
    "if no exception has occurred. You normally don't need to call\n",
    ":c`PyErr_Occurred` to see whether an error occurred in a function call,\n",
    "since you should be able to tell from the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function *f* that calls another function *g* detects that the\n",
    "latter fails, *f* should itself return an error value (usually `NULL` or\n",
    "`-1`). It should *not* call one of the :c`PyErr_\\*` functions --- one\n",
    "has already been called by *g*. *f*'s caller is then supposed to also\n",
    "return an error indication to *its* caller, again *without* calling\n",
    ":c`PyErr_\\*`, and so on --- the most detailed cause of the error was\n",
    "already reported by the function that first detected it. Once the error\n",
    "reaches the Python interpreter's main loop, this aborts the currently\n",
    "executing Python code and tries to find an exception handler specified\n",
    "by the Python programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "(There are situations where a module can actually give a more detailed\n",
    "error message by calling another :c`PyErr_\\*` function, and in such\n",
    "cases it is fine to do so. As a general rule, however, this is not\n",
    "necessary, and can cause information about the cause of the error to be\n",
    "lost: most operations can fail for a variety of reasons.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To ignore an exception set by a function call that failed, the exception\n",
    "condition must be cleared explicitly by calling :c`PyErr_Clear`. The\n",
    "only time C code should call :c`PyErr_Clear` is if it doesn't want to\n",
    "pass the error on to the interpreter but wants to handle it completely\n",
    "by itself (possibly by trying something else, or pretending nothing went\n",
    "wrong).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every failing :c`malloc` call must be turned into an exception --- the\n",
    "direct caller of :c`malloc` (or :c`realloc`) must call\n",
    ":c`PyErr_NoMemory` and return a failure indicator itself. All the\n",
    "object-creating functions (for example, :c`PyLong_FromLong`) already do\n",
    "this, so this note is only relevant to those who call :c`malloc`\n",
    "directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that, with the important exception of :c`PyArg_ParseTuple` and\n",
    "friends, functions that return an integer status usually return a\n",
    "positive value or zero for success and `-1` for failure, like Unix\n",
    "system calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, be careful to clean up garbage (by making :c`Py_XDECREF` or\n",
    ":c`Py_DECREF` calls for objects you have already created) when you\n",
    "return an error indicator!\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of which exception to raise is entirely yours. There are\n",
    "predeclared C objects corresponding to all built-in Python exceptions,\n",
    "such as :c`PyExc_ZeroDivisionError`, which you can use directly. Of\n",
    "course, you should choose exceptions wisely --- don't use\n",
    ":c`PyExc_TypeError` to mean that a file couldn't be opened (that should\n",
    "probably be :c`PyExc_IOError`). If something's wrong with the argument\n",
    "list, the :c`PyArg_ParseTuple` function usually raises\n",
    ":c`PyExc_TypeError`. If you have an argument whose value must be in a\n",
    "particular range or must satisfy other conditions, :c`PyExc_ValueError`\n",
    "is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define a new exception that is unique to your module. For\n",
    "this, you usually declare a static object variable at the beginning of\n",
    "your file:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "static PyObject *SpamError;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and initialize it in your module's initialization function\n",
    "(:c`PyInit_spam`) with an exception object:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "PyMODINIT_FUNC\n",
    "PyInit_spam(void)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    PyObject *m;\n",

    "    Py_XINCREF(SpamError);\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return m;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Python name for the exception object is `spam.error`. The\n",
    ":c`PyErr_NewException` function may create a class with the base class\n",
    "being `Exception` (unless another class is passed in instead of `NULL`),\n",
    "described in `bltin-exceptions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the :c`SpamError` variable retains a reference to the\n",
    "newly created exception class; this is intentional! Since the exception\n",
    "could be removed from the module by external code, an owned reference to\n",
    "the class is needed to ensure that it will not be discarded, causing\n",
    ":c`SpamError` to become a dangling pointer. Should it become a dangling\n",
    "pointer, C code which raises the exception could cause a core dump or\n",
    "other unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss the use of `PyMODINIT_FUNC` as a function return type later\n",
    "in this sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `spam.error` exception can be raised in your extension module using\n",

    "\n",
    "## Back to the Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our example function, you should now be able to understand\n",

    "pointers) if an error is detected in the argument list, relying on the\n",
    "exception set by :c`PyArg_ParseTuple`. Otherwise the string value of the\n",
    "argument has been copied to the local variable :c`command`. This is a\n",

    "\n",
    "Note the third entry (`METH_VARARGS`). This is a flag telling the\n",

    "`METH_VARARGS | METH_KEYWORDS`; a value of `0` means that an obsolete\n",
    "variant of :c`PyArg_ParseTuple` is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using only `METH_VARARGS`, the function should expect the\n",
    "Python-level parameters to be passed in as a tuple acceptable for\n",

    "especially the case for libraries that support so-called \"callback\"\n",
    "functions. If a C interface makes use of callbacks, the equivalent\n",
    "Python often needs to provide a callback mechanism to the Python\n",
    "programmer; the implementation will require calling the Python callback\n",
    "functions from a C callback. Other uses are also imaginable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the Python interpreter is easily called recursively, and\n",
    "there is a standard interface to call a Python function. (I won't dwell\n",
    "on how to call the Python parser with a particular string as input ---\n",
    "if you're interested, have a look at the implementation of the `-c`\n",
    "command line option in `Modules/main.c` from the Python source code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling a Python function is easy. First, the Python program must\n",
    "somehow pass you the Python function object. You should provide a\n",
    "function (or some other interface) to do this. When this function is\n",
    "called, save a pointer to the Python function object (be careful to\n",
    ":c`Py_INCREF` it!) in a global variable --- or wherever you see fit. For\n",

    "been incremented. So, unless you want to save it in a global variable,\n",
    "you should somehow :c`Py_DECREF` the result, even (especially!) if you\n",
    "are not interested in its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you do this, however, it is important to check that the return\n",

    "called from Python, it should now return an error indication to its\n",
    "Python caller, so the interpreter can print a stack trace, or the\n",
    "calling Python code can handle the exception. If this is not possible or\n",
    "desirable, the exception should be cleared by calling :c`PyErr_Clear`.\n",

    "``` c\n",
    "if (result == NULL)\n",
    "    return NULL; /* Pass error back */\n",
    "...use result...\n",
    "Py_DECREF(result);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the desired interface to the Python callback function, you\n",
    "may also have to provide an argument list to :c`PyObject_CallObject`. In\n",
    "some cases the argument list is also provided by the Python program,\n",
    "through the same interface that specified the callback function. It can\n",
    "then be saved and used in the same manner as the function object. In\n",
    "other cases, you may have to construct a new tuple to pass as the\n",
    "argument list. The simplest way to do this is to call :c`Py_BuildValue`.\n",
    "For example, if you want to pass an integral event code, you might use\n",
    "the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "PyObject *arglist;\n",
    "...\n",
    "arglist = Py_BuildValue(\"(l)\", eventcode);\n",

    "before the error check! Also note that strictly speaking this code is\n",
    "not complete: :c`Py_BuildValue` may run out of memory, and this should\n",
    "be checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also call a function with keyword arguments by using\n",
    ":c`PyObject_Call`, which supports arguments and keyword arguments. As in\n",

    "instance, a function may allocate a block of memory, do some\n",

    "requirements for the function may add a test to the calculation that\n",
    "detects an error condition and can return prematurely from the function.\n",
    "It's easy to forget to free the allocated memory block when taking this\n",
    "premature exit, especially when it is added later to the code. Such\n",
    "leaks, once introduced, often go undetected for a long time: the error\n",

    "apparent in a long-running process that uses the leaking function\n",
    "frequently. Therefore, it's important to prevent leaks from happening by\n",
    "having a coding convention or strategy that minimizes this kind of\n",
    "errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python makes heavy use of :c`malloc` and :c`free`, it needs a\n",
    "strategy to avoid memory leaks as well as the use of freed memory. The\n",
    "chosen method is called `reference counting`. The principle is simple:\n",
    "every object contains a counter, which is incremented when a reference\n",
    "to the object is stored somewhere, and which is decremented when a\n",
    "reference to it is deleted. When the counter reaches zero, the last\n",
    "reference to the object has been deleted and the object is freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative strategy is called `automatic garbage collection`.\n",
    "(Sometimes, reference counting is also referred to as a garbage\n",
    "collection strategy, hence my use of \"automatic\" to distinguish the\n",
    "two.) The big advantage of automatic garbage collection is that the user\n",
    "doesn't need to call :c`free` explicitly. (Another claimed advantage is\n",
    "an improvement in speed or memory usage --- this is no hard fact\n",
    "however.) The disadvantage is that for C, there is no truly portable\n",
    "automatic garbage collector, while reference counting can be implemented\n",
    "portably (as long as the functions :c`malloc` and :c`free` are available\n",
    "--- which the C Standard guarantees). Maybe some day a sufficiently\n",
    "portable automatic garbage collector will be available for C. Until\n",
    "then, we'll have to live with reference counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python uses the traditional reference counting implementation, it\n",
    "also offers a cycle detector that works to detect reference cycles. This\n",
    "allows applications to not worry about creating direct or indirect\n",
    "circular references; these are the weakness of garbage collection\n",
    "implemented using only reference counting. Reference cycles consist of\n",
    "objects which contain (possibly indirect) references to themselves, so\n",

    "Typical reference counting implementations are not able to reclaim the\n",
    "memory belonging to any objects in a reference cycle, or referenced from\n",
    "the objects in the cycle, even though there are no further references to\n",
    "the cycle itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle detector is able to detect garbage cycles and can reclaim\n",
    "them. The `gc` module exposes a way to run the detector (the\n",
    "`~gc.collect` function), as well as configuration interfaces and the\n",
    "ability to disable the detector at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Counting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two macros, `Py_INCREF(x)` and `Py_DECREF(x)`, which handle\n",
    "the incrementing and decrementing of the reference count. :c`Py_DECREF`\n",
    "also frees the object when the count reaches zero. For flexibility, it\n",
    "doesn't call :c`free` directly --- rather, it makes a call through a\n",
    "function pointer in the object's `type object`. For this purpose (and\n",
    "others), every object also contains a pointer to its type object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big question now remains: when to use `Py_INCREF(x)` and\n",
    "`Py_DECREF(x)`? Let's first introduce some terms. Nobody \"owns\" an\n",
    "object; however, you can `own a reference` to an object. An object's\n",
    "reference count is now defined as the number of owned references to it.\n",
    "The owner of a reference is responsible for calling :c`Py_DECREF` when\n",
    "the reference is no longer needed. Ownership of a reference can be\n",
    "transferred. There are three ways to dispose of an owned reference: pass\n",
    "it on, store it, or call :c`Py_DECREF`. Forgetting to dispose of an\n",
    "owned reference creates a memory leak.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to `borrow`[2] a reference to an object. The\n",
    "borrower of a reference should not call :c`Py_DECREF`. The borrower must\n",
    "not hold on to the object longer than the owner from which it was\n",
    "borrowed. Using a borrowed reference after the owner has disposed of it\n",
    "risks using freed memory and should be avoided completely[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of borrowing over owning a reference is that you don't\n",
    "need to take care of disposing of the reference on all possible paths\n",
    "through the code --- in other words, with a borrowed reference you don't\n",
    "run the risk of leaking when a premature exit is taken. The disadvantage\n",
    "of borrowing over owning is that there are some subtle situations where\n",
    "in seemingly correct code a borrowed reference can be used after the\n",
    "owner from which it was borrowed has in fact disposed of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A borrowed reference can be changed into an owned reference by calling\n",
    ":c`Py_INCREF`. This does not affect the status of the owner from which\n",
    "the reference was borrowed --- it creates a new owned reference, and\n",
    "gives full owner responsibilities (the new owner must dispose of the\n",
    "reference properly, as well as the previous owner).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ownership Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever an object reference is passed into or out of a function, it is\n",
    "part of the function's interface specification whether ownership is\n",
    "transferred with the reference or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most functions that return a reference to an object pass on ownership\n",
    "with the reference. In particular, all functions whose function it is to\n",
    "create a new object, such as :c`PyLong_FromLong` and :c`Py_BuildValue`,\n",
    "pass ownership to the receiver. Even if the object is not actually new,\n",
    "you still receive ownership of a new reference to that object. For\n",
    "instance, :c`PyLong_FromLong` maintains a cache of popular values and\n",
    "can return a reference to a cached item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many functions that extract objects from other objects also transfer\n",
    "ownership with the reference, for instance :c`PyObject_GetAttrString`.\n",
    "The picture is less clear, here, however, since a few common routines\n",
    "are exceptions: :c`PyTuple_GetItem`, :c`PyList_GetItem`,\n",
    ":c`PyDict_GetItem`, and :c`PyDict_GetItemString` all return references\n",
    "that you borrow from the tuple, list or dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function :c`PyImport_AddModule` also returns a borrowed reference,\n",
    "even though it may actually create the object it returns: this is\n",
    "possible because an owned reference to the object is stored in\n",
    "`sys.modules`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pass an object reference into another function, in general, the\n",
    "function borrows the reference from you --- if it needs to store it, it\n",
    "will use :c`Py_INCREF` to become an independent owner. There are exactly\n",
    "two important exceptions to this rule: :c`PyTuple_SetItem` and\n",
    ":c`PyList_SetItem`. These functions take over ownership of the item\n",
    "passed to them --- even if they fail! (Note that :c`PyDict_SetItem` and\n",
    "friends don't take over ownership --- they are \"normal.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "When a C function is called from Python, it borrows references to its\n",
    "arguments from the caller. The caller owns a reference to the object, so\n",
    "the borrowed reference's lifetime is guaranteed until the function\n",
    "returns. Only when such a borrowed reference must be stored or passed\n",
    "on, it must be turned into an owned reference by calling :c`Py_INCREF`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object reference returned from a C function that is called from\n",
    "Python must be an owned reference --- ownership is transferred from the\n",
    "function to its caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thin Ice\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few situations where seemingly harmless use of a borrowed\n",
    "reference can lead to problems. These all have to do with implicit\n",
    "invocations of the interpreter, which can cause the owner of a reference\n",
    "to dispose of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important case to know about is using :c`Py_DECREF`\n",
    "on an unrelated object while borrowing a reference to a list item. For\n",

    "This function first borrows a reference to `list[0]`, then replaces\n",

    "Looks harmless, right? But it's not!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's follow the control flow into :c`PyList_SetItem`. The list owns\n",
    "references to all its items, so when item 1 is replaced, it has to\n",
    "dispose of the original item 1. Now let's suppose the original item 1\n",
    "was an instance of a user-defined class, and let's further suppose that\n",
    "the class defined a `__del__` method. If this class instance has a\n",
    "reference count of 1, disposing of it will call its `__del__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is written in Python, the `__del__` method can execute\n",
    "arbitrary Python code. Could it perhaps do something to invalidate the\n",
    "reference to `item` in :c`bug`? You bet! Assuming that the list passed\n",
    "into :c`bug` is accessible to the `__del__` method, it could execute a\n",
    "statement to the effect of `del list[0]`, and assuming this was the last\n",
    "reference to that object, it would free the memory associated with it,\n",
    "thereby invalidating `item`.\n",

    "The second case of problems with a borrowed reference is a variant\n",

    "Many extension modules just provide new functions and types to be used\n",
    "from Python, but sometimes the code in an extension module can be useful\n",
    "for other extension modules. For example, an extension module could\n",

    "have a set of C functions for direct manipulation from other extension\n",
    "modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight this seems easy: just write the functions (without\n",
    "declaring them `static`, of course), provide an appropriate header file,\n",
    "and document the C API. And in fact this would work if all extension\n",
    "modules were always linked statically with the Python interpreter. When\n",
    "modules are used as shared libraries, however, the symbols defined in\n",
    "one module may not be visible to another module. The details of\n",
    "visibility depend on the operating system; some systems use one global\n",

    "different strategies (most Unices). And even if symbols are globally\n",
    "visible, the module whose functions one wishes to call might not have\n",
    "been loaded yet!\n",

    "around like any other Python object. In particular, they can be assigned\n",
    "to a name in an extension module's namespace. Other extension modules\n",
    "can then import this module, retrieve the value of this name, and then\n",
