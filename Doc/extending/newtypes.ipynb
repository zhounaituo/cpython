    "# Defining Extension Types: Assorted Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "This section aims to give a quick fly-by on the various type methods you\n",
    "can implement and what they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the definition of :c`PyTypeObject`, with some fields only used\n",
    "in `debug builds <debug-build>` omitted:\n",
    "\n",
    "../includes/typestruct.h\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that's a *lot* of methods. Don't worry too much though -- if you\n",
    "have a type you want to define, the chances are very good that you will\n",
    "only implement a handful of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you probably expect by now, we're going to go over this and give more\n",
    "information about the various handlers. We won't go in the order they\n",
    "are defined in the structure, because there is a lot of historical\n",
    "baggage that impacts the ordering of the fields. It's often easiest to\n",
    "find an example that includes the fields you need and then change the\n",
    "values to suit your new type. :\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "const char *tp_name; /* For printing */\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the type -- as mentioned in the previous chapter, this will\n",
    "appear in various places, almost entirely for diagnostic purposes. Try\n",
    "to choose something that will be helpful in such a situation! :\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "Py_ssize_t tp_basicsize, tp_itemsize; /* For allocation */\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These fields tell the runtime how much memory to allocate when new\n",
    "objects of this type are created. Python has some built-in support for\n",
    "variable length structures (think: strings, tuples) which is where the\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_itemsize` field comes in. This will be dealt with\n",
    "later. :\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "const char *tp_doc;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can put a string (or its address) that you want returned when\n",
    "the Python script references `obj.__doc__` to retrieve the doc string.\n",

    "If your type has memory to free or other clean-up to perform, you can\n",

    "One important requirement of the deallocator function is that it leaves\n",
    "any pending exceptions alone. This is important since deallocators are\n",
    "frequently called as the interpreter unwinds the Python stack; when the\n",
    "stack is unwound due to an exception (rather than normal returns),\n",
    "nothing is done to protect the deallocators from seeing that an\n",
    "exception has already been set. Any actions which a deallocator performs\n",
    "which may cause additional Python code to be executed may detect that an\n",
    "exception has been set. This can lead to misleading errors from the\n",
    "interpreter. The proper way to protect against this is to save a pending\n",
    "exception before performing the unsafe action, and restoring it when\n",
    "done. This can be done using the :c`PyErr_Fetch` and :c`PyErr_Restore`\n",
    "functions:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "There are limitations to what you can safely do in a deallocator\n",
    "function. First, if your type supports garbage collection (using\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` and/or :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_clear`), some\n",
    "of the object's members can have been cleared or finalized by the time\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc` is called. Second, in\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc`, your object is in an unstable state: its\n",
    "reference count is equal to zero. Any call to a non-trivial object or\n",
    "API (as in the example above) might end up calling\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc` again, causing a double free and a crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with Python 3.4, it is recommended not to put any complex\n",

    "single: string; object representation builtin: repr\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two ways to generate a textual representation of an\n",
    "object: the `repr` function, and the `str` function. (The `print`\n",
    "function just calls `str`.) These handlers are both optional.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_repr` handler should return a string object\n",
    "containing a representation of the instance for which it is called. Here\n",
    "is a simple example:\n",

    "``` c\n",
    "static PyObject *\n",

    "object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_str` handler is to `str` what the\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_repr` handler described above is to `repr`; that is,\n",

    "Its implementation is very similar to the :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_repr`\n",
    "function, but the resulting string is intended for human consumption. If\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_str` is not specified, the :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_repr`\n",

    "## Attribute Management\n",
    "\n",
    "For every object which can support attributes, the corresponding type\n",
    "must provide the functions that control how the attributes are resolved.\n",
    "There needs to be a function which can retrieve attributes (if any are\n",
    "defined), and another to set attributes (if setting attributes is\n",
    "allowed). Removing an attribute is a special case, for which the new\n",
    "value passed to the handler is `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports two pairs of attribute handlers; a type that supports\n",
    "attributes only needs to implement the functions for one pair. The\n",
    "difference is that one pair takes the name of the attribute as a\n",
    ":c`char\\*`, while the other accepts a :c`PyObject\\*`. Each type can use\n",
    "whichever pair makes more sense for the implementation's convenience. :\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "getattrfunc  tp_getattr;        /* char * version */\n",
    "setattrfunc  tp_setattr;\n",
    "/* ... */\n",
    "getattrofunc tp_getattro;       /* PyObject * version */\n",
    "setattrofunc tp_setattro;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If accessing attributes of an object is always a simple operation (this\n",
    "will be explained shortly), there are generic implementations which can\n",
    "be used to provide the :c`PyObject\\*` version of the attribute\n",
    "management functions. The actual need for type-specific attribute\n",
    "handlers almost completely disappeared starting with Python 2.2, though\n",
    "there are many examples which have not been updated to use some of the\n",
    "new generic mechanism that is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generic Attribute Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Most extension types only use *simple* attributes. So, what makes the\n",
    "attributes simple? There are only a couple of conditions that must be\n",
    "met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The name of the attributes must be known when :c`PyType_Ready` is\n",
    "    called.\n",
    "2.  No special processing is needed to record that an attribute was\n",
    "    looked up or set, nor do actions need to be taken based on the\n",
    "    value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this list does not place any restrictions on the values of the\n",
    "attributes, when the values are computed, or how relevant data is\n",
    "stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "When :c`PyType_Ready` is called, it uses three tables referenced by the\n",
    "type object to create `descriptor`s which are placed in the dictionary\n",
    "of the type object. Each descriptor controls access to one attribute of\n",
    "the instance object. Each of the tables is optional; if all three are\n",
    "`NULL`, instances of the type will only have attributes that are\n",
    "inherited from their base type, and should leave the\n",
    ":c`~PyTypeObject.tp_getattro` and :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_setattro` fields\n",
    "`NULL` as well, allowing the base type to handle attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tables are declared as three fields of the type object:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "struct PyMethodDef *tp_methods;\n",
    "struct PyMemberDef *tp_members;\n",
    "struct PyGetSetDef *tp_getset;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_methods` is not `NULL`, it must refer to an array\n",
    "of :c`PyMethodDef` structures. Each entry in the table is an instance of\n",

    "\n",
    "``` c\n",

    "entries are needed for methods inherited from a base type. One\n",
    "additional entry is needed at the end; it is a sentinel that marks the\n",
    "end of the array. The `ml_name` field of the sentinel must be `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second table is used to define attributes which map directly to data\n",
    "stored in the instance. A variety of primitive C types are supported,\n",
    "and access may be read-only or read-write. The structures in the table\n",
