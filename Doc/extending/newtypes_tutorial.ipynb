    "Python allows the writer of a C extension module to define new types\n",
    "that can be manipulated from Python code, much like the built-in `str`\n",
    "and `list` types. The code for all extension types follows a pattern,\n",
    "but there are some details that you need to understand before you can\n",
    "get started. This document is a gentle introduction to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CPython` runtime sees all Python objects as variables of type\n",
    ":c`PyObject\\*`, which serves as a \"base type\" for all Python objects.\n",
    "The :c`PyObject` structure itself only contains the object's\n",
    "`reference count` and a pointer to the object's \"type object\". This is\n",
    "where the action is; the type object determines which (C) functions get\n",
    "called by the interpreter when, for instance, an attribute gets looked\n",
    "up on an object, a method called, or it is multiplied by another object.\n",
    "These C functions are called \"type methods\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you want to define a new extension type, you need to create a new\n",
    "type object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of thing can only be explained by example, so here's a\n",
    "minimal, but complete, module that defines a new type named `Custom`\n",
    "inside a C extension module `custom`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're showing here is the traditional way of defining *static*\n",
    "extension types. It should be adequate for most uses. The C API also\n",
    "allows defining heap-allocated extension types using the\n",
    ":c`PyType_FromSpec` function, which isn't covered in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "../includes/custom.c\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that's quite a bit to take in at once, but hopefully bits will seem\n",
    "familiar from the previous chapter. This file defines three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What a `Custom` **object** contains: this is the `CustomObject`\n",
    "    struct, which is allocated once for each `Custom` instance.\n",
    "2.  How the `Custom` **type** behaves: this is the `CustomType` struct,\n",
    "    which defines a set of flags and function pointers that the\n",
    "    interpreter inspects when specific operations are requested.\n",
    "3.  How to initialize the `custom` module: this is the `PyInit_custom`\n",
    "    function and the associated `custommodule` struct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first bit is:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "typedef struct {\n",
    "    PyObject_HEAD\n",
    "} CustomObject;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what a Custom object will contain. `PyObject_HEAD` is mandatory\n",
    "at the start of each object struct and defines a field called `ob_base`\n",
    "of type :c`PyObject`, containing a pointer to a type object and a\n",
    "reference count (these can be accessed using the macros :c`Py_TYPE` and\n",
    ":c`Py_REFCNT` respectively). The reason for the macro is to abstract\n",
    "away the layout and to enable additional fields in `debug builds\n",
    "<debug-build>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no semicolon above after the :c`PyObject_HEAD` macro. Be wary\n",
    "of adding one by accident: some compilers will complain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, objects generally store additional data besides the standard\n",
    "`PyObject_HEAD` boilerplate; for example, here is the definition for\n",
    "standard Python floats:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "typedef struct {\n",
    "    PyObject_HEAD\n",
    "    double ob_fval;\n",
    "} PyFloatObject;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second bit is the definition of the type object. :\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "static PyTypeObject CustomType = {\n",
    "    PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL, 0)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",

    "We recommend using C99-style designated initializers as above, to avoid\n",
    "listing all the :c`PyTypeObject` fields that you don't care about and\n",
    "also to avoid caring about the fields' declaration order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual definition of :c`PyTypeObject` in `object.h` has many more\n",
    "`fields <type-structs>` than the definition above. The remaining fields\n",
    "will be filled with zeros by the C compiler, and it's common practice to\n",
    "not specify them explicitly unless you need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to pick it apart, one field at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    "PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line is mandatory boilerplate to initialize the `ob_base` field\n",
    "mentioned above. :\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    ".tp_name = \"custom.Custom\",\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of our type. This will appear in the default textual\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the name is a dotted name that includes both the module name\n",
    "and the name of the type within the module. The module in this case is\n",
    "`custom` and the type is `Custom`, so we set the type name to\n",
    "`custom.Custom`. Using the real dotted import path is important to make\n",
    "your type compatible with the `pydoc` and `pickle` modules. :\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",
    ".tp_basicsize = sizeof(CustomObject),\n",
    ".tp_itemsize = 0,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is so that Python knows how much memory to allocate when creating\n",
    "new `Custom` instances. :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_itemsize` is only used for\n",
    "variable-sized objects and should otherwise be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want your type to be subclassable from Python, and your type has\n",
    "the same :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_basicsize` as its base type, you may have\n",

    "larger value for :c`~PyTypeObject.tp_basicsize` than its base type does.\n",
    "Most of the time, this will be true anyway, because either your base\n",
    "type will be `object`, or else you will be adding data members to your\n",
    "base type, and therefore increasing its size.\n",

    ".tp_flags = Py_TPFLAGS_DEFAULT,\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All types should include this constant in their flags. It enables all of\n",

    "\n",
    "In the second version of the `Custom` example, we allowed any kind of\n",
