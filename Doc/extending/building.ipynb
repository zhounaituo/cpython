    "# Building C and C++ Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A C extension for CPython is a shared library (e.g. a `.so` file on\n",
    "Linux, `.pyd` on Windows), which exports an *initialization function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be importable, the shared library must be available on `PYTHONPATH`,\n",
    "and must be named after the module name, with an appropriate extension.\n",
    "When using distutils, the correct filename is generated automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialization function has the signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns either a fully-initialized module, or a :c`PyModuleDef`\n",
    "instance. See `initializing-modules` for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For modules with ASCII-only names, the function must be named\n",
    "`PyInit_<modulename>`, with `<modulename>` replaced by the name of the\n",
    "module. When using `multi-phase-initialization`, non-ASCII module names\n",
    "are allowed. In this case, the initialization function name is\n",
    "`PyInitU_<modulename>`, with `<modulename>` encoded using Python's\n",
    "*punycode* encoding with hyphens replaced by underscores. In Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def initfunc_name(name):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        suffix = b'_' + name.encode('ascii')\n",
    "    except UnicodeEncodeError:\n",
    "        suffix = b'U_' + name.encode('punycode').replace(b'-', b'_')\n",
    "    return b'PyInit' + suffix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to export multiple modules from a single shared library\n",
    "by defining multiple initialization functions. However, importing them\n",
    "requires using symbolic links or a custom importer, because by default\n",
    "only the function corresponding to the filename is found. See the\n",
    "*\"Multiple modules in one library\"* section in `489` for details.\n",

    "Extension modules can be built using distutils, which is included in\n",

    "don't necessarily need a compiler and distutils to install the\n",
    "extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "A distutils package contains a driver script, `setup.py`. This is a\n",
    "plain Python file, which, in the most simple case, could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python3\n",
    "from distutils.core import setup, Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "module1 = Extension('demo',\n",

    "       description = 'This is a demo package',\n",
    "       ext_modules = [module1])\n",
    "```\n",

    "With this `setup.py`, and a file `demo.c`, running :\n",
    "\n",
    "``` c\n",

    "```\n",

    "will compile `demo.c`, and produce an extension module named `demo` in\n",
    "the `build` directory. Depending on the system, the module file will end\n",
    "up in a subdirectory `build/lib.system`, and may have a name like\n",
    "`demo.so` or `demo.pyd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `setup.py`, all execution is performed by calling the `setup`\n",
    "function. This takes a variable number of keyword arguments, of which\n",
    "the example above uses only a subset. Specifically, the example\n",
    "specifies meta-information to build packages, and it specifies the\n",
    "contents of the package. Normally, a package will contain additional\n",
    "modules, like Python source modules, documentation, subpackages, etc.\n",
    "Please refer to the distutils documentation in `distutils-index` to\n",
    "learn more about the features of distutils; this section explains\n",
    "building extension modules only.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to pre-compute arguments to `setup`, to better structure\n",
    "the driver script. In the example above, the `ext_modules` argument to\n",
    "`~distutils.core.setup` is a list of extension modules, each of which is\n",
