    "This module contains functions to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on\n",
    "a fault, after a timeout, or on a user signal. Call\n",
    "`faulthandler.enable` to install fault handlers for the `SIGSEGV`,\n",
    "`SIGFPE`, `SIGABRT`, `SIGBUS`, and `SIGILL` signals. You can also enable\n",
    "them at startup by setting the `PYTHONFAULTHANDLER` environment variable\n",
    "or by using the `-X` `faulthandler` command line option.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport\n",
    "or the Windows fault handler. The module uses an alternative stack for\n",
    "signal handlers if the :c`sigaltstack` function is available. This\n",
    "allows it to dump the traceback even on a stack overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fault handler is called on catastrophic cases and therefore can only\n",
    "use signal-safe functions (e.g. it cannot allocate memory on the heap).\n",
    "Because of this limitation traceback dumping is minimal compared to\n",
    "normal Python tracebacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Only ASCII is supported. The `backslashreplace` error handler is\n",
    "    used on encoding.\n",
    "-   Each string is limited to 500 characters.\n",
    "-   Only the filename, the function name and the line number are\n",
    "    displayed. (no source code)\n",
    "-   It is limited to 100 frames and 100 threads.\n",
    "-   The order is reversed: the most recent call is shown first.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the Python traceback is written to `sys.stderr`. To see\n",
    "tracebacks, applications must be run in the terminal. A log file can\n",
    "alternatively be passed to `faulthandler.enable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module is implemented in C, so tracebacks can be dumped on a crash\n",
    "or when Python is deadlocked.\n",
    "\n",

    ":c`_exit` exits the process immediately, which means it doesn't do any\n",
    "cleanup like flushing file buffers.) If the function is called twice,\n",
    "the new call replaces previous parameters and resets the timeout. The\n",
    "timer has a sub-second resolution.\n",
