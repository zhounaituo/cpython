    "In the Python 2.x series, this module contained `camelCase` names for\n",

    "The design of this module is loosely based on Java's threading model.\n",
    "However, where Java makes locks and condition variables basic behavior\n",
    "of every object, they are separate objects in Python. Python's `Thread`\n",
    "class supports a subset of the behavior of Java's Thread class;\n",
    "currently, there are no priorities, no thread groups, and threads cannot\n",
    "be destroyed, stopped, suspended, resumed, or interrupted. The static\n",
    "methods of Java's Thread class, when implemented, are mapped to\n",
    "module-level functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the methods described below are executed atomically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thread-Local Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread-local data is data whose values are thread specific. To manage\n",
    "thread-local data, just create an instance of `local` (or a subclass)\n",
    "and store attributes on it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mydata = threading.local()\n",
    "    mydata.x = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The instance's values will be different for separate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class that represents thread-local data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details and extensive examples, see the documentation string of\n",
    "the `_threading_local` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thread Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Thread` class represents an activity that is run in a separate\n",
    "thread of control. There are two ways to specify the activity: by\n",
    "passing a callable object to the constructor, or by overriding the\n",
    "`~Thread.run` method in a subclass. No other methods (except for the\n",
    "constructor) should be overridden in a subclass. In other words, *only*\n",
    "override the `~Thread.__init__` and `~Thread.run` methods of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a thread object is created, its activity must be started by calling\n",
    "the thread's `~Thread.start` method. This invokes the `~Thread.run`\n",
    "method in a separate thread of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the thread's activity is started, the thread is considered 'alive'.\n",
    "It stops being alive when its `~Thread.run` method terminates -- either\n",
    "normally, or by raising an unhandled exception. The `~Thread.is_alive`\n",
    "method tests whether the thread is alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other threads can call a thread's `~Thread.join` method. This blocks the\n",
    "calling thread until the thread whose `~Thread.join` method is called is\n",
    "terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread has a name. The name can be passed to the constructor, and read\n",
    "or changed through the `~Thread.name` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `~Thread.run` method raises an exception, `threading.excepthook`\n",
    "is called to handle it. By default, `threading.excepthook` ignores\n",
    "silently `SystemExit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread can be flagged as a \"daemon thread\". The significance of this\n",
    "flag is that the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads\n",
    "are left. The initial value is inherited from the creating thread. The\n",
    "flag can be set through the `~Thread.daemon` property or the *daemon*\n",
    "constructor argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Daemon threads are abruptly stopped at shutdown. Their resources (such\n",
    "as open files, database transactions, etc.) may not be released\n",
    "properly. If you want your threads to stop gracefully, make them\n",
    "non-daemonic and use a suitable signalling mechanism such as an `Event`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a \"main thread\" object; this corresponds to the initial thread\n",
    "of control in the Python program. It is not a daemon thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is the possibility that \"dummy thread objects\" are created. These\n",
    "are thread objects corresponding to \"alien threads\", which are threads\n",
    "of control started outside the threading module, such as directly from C\n",
    "code. Dummy thread objects have limited functionality; they are always\n",
    "considered alive and daemonic, and cannot be\n",
    "`joined <meth-thread-join>`. They are never deleted, since it is\n",
    "impossible to detect the termination of alien threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constructor should always be called with keyword arguments.\n",
    "Arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*group* should be `None`; reserved for future extension when a\n",
    "`ThreadGroup` class is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "*target* is the callable object to be invoked by the `run` method.\n",
    "Defaults to `None`, meaning nothing is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "*name* is the thread name. By default, a unique name is constructed of\n",
    "the form \"Thread-*N*\" where *N* is a small decimal number, or\n",
    "\"Thread-*N* (target)\" where \"target\" is `target.__name__` if the\n",
    "*target* argument is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "*args* is a list or tuple of arguments for the target invocation.\n",
    "Defaults to `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*kwargs* is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target invocation.\n",
    "Defaults to `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not `None`, *daemon* explicitly sets whether the thread is daemonic.\n",
    "If `None` (the default), the daemonic property is inherited from the\n",
    "current thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure to invoke\n",
    "the base class constructor (`Thread.__init__()`) before doing anything\n",
    "else to the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 Use the *target* name if *name* argument is omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Added the *daemon* argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "start()\n",

    "*target* argument, if any, with positional and keyword arguments taken\n",
    "from the *args* and *kwargs* arguments, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using list or tuple as the *args* argument which passed to the `Thread`\n",
