    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you wanted to get the version string for a package you've\n",
    "installed using `pip`. We start by creating a virtual environment and\n",
    "installing something into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell-session\n",
    "$ python3 -m venv example\n",
    "$ source example/bin/activate\n",
    "(example) $ python -m pip install wheel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the version string for `wheel` by running the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` pycon\n",
    "(example) $ python\n",
    ">>> from importlib.metadata import version  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    ">>> version('wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "'0.32.3'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get the set of entry points keyed by group, such as\n",
    "`console_scripts`, `distutils.commands` and others. Each group contains\n",
    "a sequence of `EntryPoint <entry-points>` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the `metadata for a distribution <metadata>`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> list(metadata('wheel'))  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    ['Metadata-Version', 'Name', 'Version', 'Summary', 'Home-page', 'Author', 'Author-email', 'Maintainer', 'Maintainer-email', 'License', 'Project-URL', 'Project-URL', 'Project-URL', 'Keywords', 'Platform', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Classifier', 'Requires-Python', 'Provides-Extra', 'Requires-Dist', 'Requires-Dist']\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get a `distribution's version number <version>`, list its\n",
    "`constituent files <files>`, and get a list of the distribution's\n",
    "`requirements`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional API\n",
    "\n",
    "This package provides the following functionality via its public API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entry points\n",
    "\n",
    "The `entry_points()` function returns a collection of entry points.\n",
    "Entry points are represented by `EntryPoint` instances; each\n",
    "`EntryPoint` has a `.name`, `.group`, and `.value` attributes and a\n",
    "`.load()` method to resolve the value. There are also `.module`,\n",
    "`.attr`, and `.extras` attributes for getting the components of the\n",
    "`.value` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query all entry points:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> eps = entry_points()  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "\n",
    "The `entry_points()` function returns an `EntryPoints` object, a\n",
    "sequence of all `EntryPoint` objects with `names` and `groups`\n",
    "attributes for convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> sorted(eps.groups)  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    ['console_scripts', 'distutils.commands', 'distutils.setup_keywords', 'egg_info.writers', 'setuptools.installation']\n",
    "\n",
    "`EntryPoints` has a `select` method to select entry points matching\n",
    "specific properties. Select entry points in the `console_scripts` group:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> scripts = eps.select(group='console_scripts')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, since `entry_points` passes keyword arguments through to\n",
    "select:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> scripts = entry_points(group='console_scripts')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick out a specific script named \"wheel\" (found in the wheel project):\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 'wheel' in scripts.names  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    True\n",
    "    >>> wheel = scripts['wheel']  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, query for that entry point during selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> (wheel,) = entry_points(group='console_scripts', name='wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    >>> (wheel,) = entry_points().select(group='console_scripts', name='wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect the resolved entry point:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> wheel  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    EntryPoint(name='wheel', value='wheel.cli:main', group='console_scripts')\n",
    "    >>> wheel.module  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    'wheel.cli'\n",
    "    >>> wheel.attr  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    'main'\n",
    "    >>> wheel.extras  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    []\n",
    "    >>> main = wheel.load()  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    >>> main  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    <function main at 0x103528488>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `group` and `name` are arbitrary values defined by the package\n",
    "author and usually a client will wish to resolve all entry points for a\n",
    "particular group. Read [the setuptools\n",
    "docs](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins)\n",
    "for more information on entry points, their definition, and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Compatibility Note*\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"selectable\" entry points were introduced in `importlib_metadata`\n",
    "3.6 and Python 3.10. Prior to those changes, `entry_points` accepted no\n",
    "parameters and always returned a dictionary of entry points, keyed by\n",
    "group. For compatibility, if no parameters are passed to entry_points, a\n",
    "`SelectableGroups` object is returned, implementing that dict interface.\n",
    "In the future, calling `entry_points` with no parameters will return an\n",
    "`EntryPoints` object. Users should rely on the selection interface to\n",
    "retrieve entry points by group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Every distribution includes some metadata, which you can extract using\n",
    "the `metadata()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> wheel_metadata = metadata('wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "\n",
    "The keys of the returned data structure, a `PackageMetadata`, name the\n",
    "metadata keywords, and the values are returned unparsed from the\n",
    "distribution metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> wheel_metadata['Requires-Python']  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    '>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*'\n",
    "\n",
    "`PackageMetadata` also presents a `json` attribute that returns all the\n",
    "metadata in a JSON-compatible form per\n",
    "[PEP 566](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0566/ \"PEP 566\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> wheel_metadata.json['requires_python']\n",
    "    '>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*'\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 The `Description` is now included in the metadata when presented\n",
    "through the payload. Line continuation characters have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 The `json` attribute was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution versions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `version()` function is the quickest way to get a distribution's\n",
    "version number, as a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> version('wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    '0.32.3'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution files\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get the full set of files contained within a distribution.\n",
    "The `files()` function takes a distribution package name and returns all\n",
    "of the files installed by this distribution. Each file object returned\n",
    "is a `PackagePath`, a `pathlib.PurePath` derived object with additional\n",
    "`dist`, `size`, and `hash` properties as indicated by the metadata. For\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> util = [p for p in files('wheel') if 'util.py' in str(p)][0]  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    >>> util  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    PackagePath('wheel/util.py')\n",
    "    >>> util.size  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    859\n",
    "    >>> util.dist  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    <importlib.metadata._hooks.PathDistribution object at 0x101e0cef0>\n",
    "    >>> util.hash  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    <FileHash mode: sha256 value: bYkw5oMccfazVCoYQwKkkemoVyMAFoR34mmKBx8R1NI>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the file, you can also read its contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print(util.read_text())  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    import base64\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def as_bytes(s):\n",
    "        if isinstance(s, text_type):\n",
    "            return s.encode('utf-8')\n",
    "        return s\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `locate` method to get a the absolute path to the\n",
    "file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> util.locate()  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    PosixPath('/home/gustav/example/lib/site-packages/wheel/util.py')\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where the metadata file listing files (RECORD or\n",
    "SOURCES.txt) is missing, `files()` will return `None`. The caller may\n",
    "wish to wrap calls to `files()` in\n",
    "[always_iterable](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#more_itertools.always_iterable)\n",
    "or otherwise guard against this condition if the target distribution is\n",
    "not known to have the metadata present.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the full set of requirements for a distribution, use the\n",
    "`requires()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> requires('wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    [\"pytest (>=3.0.0) ; extra == 'test'\", \"pytest-cov ; extra == 'test'\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenience method to resolve the distribution or distributions (in\n",
    "the case of a namespace package) for top-level Python packages or\n",
    "modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> packages_distributions()\n",
    "    {'importlib_metadata': ['importlib-metadata'], 'yaml': ['PyYAML'], 'jaraco': ['jaraco.classes', 'jaraco.functools'], ...}\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above API is the most common and convenient usage, you can get\n",
    "all of that information from the `Distribution` class. A `Distribution`\n",
    "is an abstract object that represents the metadata for a Python package.\n",
    "You can get the `Distribution` instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> from importlib.metadata import distribution  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    >>> dist = distribution('wheel')  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an alternative way to get the version number is through the\n",
    "`Distribution` instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> dist.version  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    '0.32.3'\n",
    "\n",
    "There are all kinds of additional metadata available on the\n",
    "`Distribution` instance:\n",

    "    >>> dist.metadata['Requires-Python']  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    '>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*'\n",
    "    >>> dist.metadata['License']  # doctest: +SKIP\n",
    "    'MIT'\n",
    "\n",
    "The full set of available metadata is not described here. See `566` for\n",
    "additional details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending the search algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Because package metadata is not available through `sys.path` searches,\n",
    "or package loaders directly, the metadata for a package is found through\n",
    "import system `finders <finders-and-loaders>`. To find a distribution\n",
    "package's metadata, `importlib.metadata` queries the list of\n",
    "`meta path finders <meta path finder>` on `sys.meta_path`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default `PathFinder` for Python includes a hook that calls into\n",
    "`importlib.metadata.MetadataPathFinder` for finding distributions loaded\n",
    "from typical file-system-based paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract class :py`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder` defines the\n",
    "interface expected of finders by Python's import system.\n",
    "`importlib.metadata` extends this protocol by looking for an optional\n",
    "`find_distributions` callable on the finders from `sys.meta_path` and\n",
    "presents this extended interface as the `DistributionFinder` abstract\n",
    "base class, which defines this abstract method:\n",
