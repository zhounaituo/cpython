    "This module defines two classes, `Mailbox` and `Message`, for accessing\n",
    "and manipulating on-disk mailboxes and the messages they contain.\n",
    "`Mailbox` offers a dictionary-like mapping from keys to messages.\n",
    "`Message` extends the `email.message` module's `~email.message.Message`\n",
    "class with format-specific state and behavior. Supported mailbox formats\n",
    "are Maildir, mbox, MH, Babyl, and MMDF.\n",

    "## `Mailbox` objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A mailbox, which may be inspected and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Mailbox` class defines an interface and is not intended to be\n",
    "instantiated. Instead, format-specific subclasses should inherit from\n",
    "`Mailbox` and your code should instantiate a particular subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Mailbox` interface is dictionary-like, with small keys\n",
    "corresponding to messages. Keys are issued by the `Mailbox` instance\n",
    "with which they will be used and are only meaningful to that `Mailbox`\n",
    "instance. A key continues to identify a message even if the\n",
    "corresponding message is modified, such as by replacing it with another\n",
    "message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Messages may be added to a `Mailbox` instance using the set-like method\n",
    "`add` and removed using a `del` statement or the set-like methods\n",
    "`remove` and `discard`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Mailbox` interface semantics differ from dictionary semantics in some\n",
    "noteworthy ways. Each time a message is requested, a new representation\n",
    "(typically a `Message` instance) is generated based upon the current\n",
    "state of the mailbox. Similarly, when a message is added to a `Mailbox`\n",
    "instance, the provided message representation's contents are copied. In\n",
    "neither case is a reference to the message representation kept by the\n",
    "`Mailbox` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default `Mailbox` iterator iterates over message representations,\n",
    "not keys as the default dictionary iterator does. Moreover, modification\n",
    "of a mailbox during iteration is safe and well-defined. Messages added\n",
    "to the mailbox after an iterator is created will not be seen by the\n",
    "iterator. Messages removed from the mailbox before the iterator yields\n",
    "them will be silently skipped, though using a key from an iterator may\n",
    "result in a `KeyError` exception if the corresponding message is\n",
    "subsequently removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "Be very cautious when modifying mailboxes that might be simultaneously\n",
    "changed by some other process. The safest mailbox format to use for such\n",
    "tasks is Maildir; try to avoid using single-file formats such as mbox\n",
    "for concurrent writing. If you're modifying a mailbox, you *must* lock\n",
    "it by calling the `lock` and `unlock` methods *before* reading any\n",
    "messages in the file or making any changes by adding or deleting a\n",
    "message. Failing to lock the mailbox runs the risk of losing messages or\n",
    "corrupting the entire mailbox.\n",
