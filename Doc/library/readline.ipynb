    "The `readline` module defines a number of functions to facilitate\n",
    "completion and reading/writing of history files from the Python\n",
    "interpreter. This module can be used directly, or via the `rlcompleter`\n",
    "module, which supports completion of Python identifiers at the\n",
    "interactive prompt. Settings made using this module affect the behaviour\n",
    "of both the interpreter's interactive prompt and the prompts offered by\n",
    "the built-in `input` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readline keybindings may be configured via an initialization file,\n",
    "typically `.inputrc` in your home directory. See [Readline Init\n",
    "File](https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rluserman.html#SEC9) in\n",
    "the GNU Readline manual for information about the format and allowable\n",
    "constructs of that file, and the capabilities of the Readline library in\n",
    "general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying Readline library API may be implemented by the `libedit`\n",
    "library instead of GNU readline. On macOS the `readline` module detects\n",
    "which library is being used at run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration file for `libedit` is different from that of GNU\n",
    "readline. If you programmatically load configuration strings you can\n",
    "check for the text \"libedit\" in `readline.__doc__` to differentiate\n",
    "between GNU readline and libedit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use *editline*/`libedit` readline emulation on macOS, the\n",
    "initialization file located in your home directory is named `.editrc`.\n",
    "For example, the following content in `~/.editrc` will turn ON *vi*\n",

    "\n",
    "## Init file\n",

    "The following functions relate to the init file and user configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "parse_and_bind(string)\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the init line provided in the *string* argument. This calls\n",
    ":c`rl_parse_and_bind` in the underlying library.\n",
    "\n",
    "read_init_file(\\[filename\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute a readline initialization file. The default filename is the last\n",
    "filename used. This calls :c`rl_read_init_file` in the underlying\n",

    "\n",
    "The following functions operate on the line buffer:\n",

    "\n",
    "Return the current contents of the line buffer (:c`rl_line_buffer` in\n",

    "\n",
    "write_history_file(\\[filename\\])\n",

    "The `write_history_file` function uses this value to truncate the\n",

    "get_history_item(index)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "set_auto_history(enabled)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enable or disable automatic calls to :c`add_history` when reading input\n",

    "\n",
    "Auto history is enabled by default, and changes to this do not persist\n",
