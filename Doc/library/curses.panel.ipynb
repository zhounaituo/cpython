    "Panels are windows with the added feature of depth, so they can be\n",
    "stacked on top of each other, and only the visible portions of each\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `curses.panel` defines the following functions:\n",

    "bottom_panel()\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns the bottom panel in the panel stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "new_panel(win)\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a panel object, associating it with the given window *win*. Be\n",
    "aware that you need to keep the returned panel object referenced\n",
    "explicitly. If you don't, the panel object is garbage collected and\n",
    "removed from the panel stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "top_panel()\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns the top panel in the panel stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "update_panels()\n",
    "\n",
    "Updates the virtual screen after changes in the panel stack. This does\n",
    "not call `curses.doupdate`, so you'll have to do this yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Panel Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel objects, as returned by `new_panel` above, are windows with a\n",
    "stacking order. There's always a window associated with a panel which\n",
    "determines the content, while the panel methods are responsible for the\n",
    "window's depth in the panel stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel objects have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel.above()\n",

    "\n",
    "Panel.bottom()\n",
    "\n",
    "Push the panel to the bottom of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel.hidden()\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns `True` if the panel is hidden (not visible), `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel.hide()\n",
    "\n",
    "Hide the panel. This does not delete the object, it just makes the\n",
    "window on screen invisible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel.move(y, x)\n",
    "\n",
    "Move the panel to the screen coordinates `(y, x)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Display the panel (which might have been hidden).\n",
