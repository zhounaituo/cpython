    "`IPv6Interface` is a subclass of `IPv6Address`, so it inherits all the\n",
    "attributes from that class. In addition, the following attributes are\n",

    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Interface objects support some operators. Unless stated otherwise,\n",
    "operators can only be applied between compatible objects (i.e. IPv4 with\n",
    "IPv4, IPv6 with IPv6).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Interface objects can be compared with the usual set of logical\n",
    "operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "For equality comparison (`==` and `!=`), both the IP address and network\n",
    "must be the same for the objects to be equal. An interface will not\n",
    "compare equal to any address or network object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ordering (`<`, `>`, etc) the rules are different. Interface and\n",
    "address objects with the same IP version can be compared, and the\n",
    "address objects will always sort before the interface objects. Two\n",
    "interface objects are first compared by their networks and, if those are\n",
    "the same, then by their IP addresses.\n",
