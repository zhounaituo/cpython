    "# Developing with asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming is different from classic \"sequential\"\n",
    "programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page lists common mistakes and traps and explains how to avoid\n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debug Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "By default asyncio runs in production mode. In order to ease the\n",
    "development asyncio has a *debug mode*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to enable asyncio debug mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Setting the `PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG` environment variable to `1`.\n",
    "-   Using the `Python Development Mode <devmode>`.\n",
    "-   Passing `debug=True` to `asyncio.run`.\n",
    "-   Calling `loop.set_debug`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to enabling the debug mode, consider also:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   setting the log level of the `asyncio logger <asyncio-logger>` to\n",
    "    :py`logging.DEBUG`, for example the following snippet of code can be\n",
    "    run at startup of the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   configuring the `warnings` module to display `ResourceWarning`\n",
    "    warnings. One way of doing that is by using the `-W` `default`\n",
    "    command line option.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the debug mode is enabled:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   asyncio checks for `coroutines that were not awaited\n",
    "    <asyncio-coroutine-not-scheduled>` and logs them; this mitigates the\n",
    "    \"forgotten await\" pitfall.\n",
    "-   Many non-threadsafe asyncio APIs (such as `loop.call_soon` and\n",
    "    `loop.call_at` methods) raise an exception if they are called from a\n",
    "    wrong thread.\n",
    "-   The execution time of the I/O selector is logged if it takes too\n",
    "    long to perform an I/O operation.\n",
    "-   Callbacks taking longer than 100 milliseconds are logged. The\n",
    "    `loop.slow_callback_duration` attribute can be used to set the\n",
    "    minimum execution duration in seconds that is considered \"slow\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concurrency and Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "An event loop runs in a thread (typically the main thread) and executes\n",
    "all callbacks and Tasks in its thread. While a Task is running in the\n",
    "event loop, no other Tasks can run in the same thread. When a Task\n",
    "executes an `await` expression, the running Task gets suspended, and the\n",
    "event loop executes the next Task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To schedule a `callback` from another OS thread, the\n",
    "`loop.call_soon_threadsafe` method should be used. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    loop.call_soon_threadsafe(callback, *args)\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all asyncio objects are not thread safe, which is typically not a\n",
    "problem unless there is code that works with them from outside of a Task\n",
    "or a callback. If there's a need for such code to call a low-level\n",
    "asyncio API, the `loop.call_soon_threadsafe` method should be used,\n",
    "e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    loop.call_soon_threadsafe(fut.cancel)\n",
    "\n",
    "To schedule a coroutine object from a different OS thread, the\n",
    "`run_coroutine_threadsafe` function should be used. It returns a\n",
    "`concurrent.futures.Future` to access the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    async def coro_func():\n",
    "         return await asyncio.sleep(1, 42)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Later in another OS thread:\n",
    "\n",
    "    future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro_func(), loop)\n",
    "    # Wait for the result:\n",
    "    result = future.result()\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle signals and to execute subprocesses, the event loop must be\n",
    "run in the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `loop.run_in_executor` method can be used with a\n",
    "`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to execute blocking code in a\n",
    "different OS thread without blocking the OS thread that the event loop\n",
    "runs in.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is currently no way to schedule coroutines or callbacks directly\n",
    "from a different process (such as one started with `multiprocessing`).\n",
    "The `Event Loop Methods <asyncio-event-loop>` section lists APIs that\n",
    "can read from pipes and watch file descriptors without blocking the\n",
    "event loop. In addition, asyncio's `Subprocess <asyncio-subprocess>`\n",
    "APIs provide a way to start a process and communicate with it from the\n",
    "event loop. Lastly, the aforementioned `loop.run_in_executor` method can\n",
    "also be used with a `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` to execute\n",
    "code in a different process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Blocking Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocking (CPU-bound) code should not be called directly. For example, if\n",
    "a function performs a CPU-intensive calculation for 1 second, all\n",
    "concurrent asyncio Tasks and IO operations would be delayed by 1 second.\n",
    "\n",
    "An executor can be used to run a task in a different thread or even in a\n",
    "different process to avoid blocking the OS thread with the event loop.\n",
    "See the `loop.run_in_executor` method for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio uses the `logging` module and all logging is performed via the\n",
    "`\"asyncio\"` logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default log level is :py`logging.INFO`, which can be easily\n",
    "adjusted:\n",
    "\n",
    "    logging.getLogger(\"asyncio\").setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detect never-awaited coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "When a coroutine function is called, but not awaited (e.g. `coro()`\n",
    "instead of `await coro()`) or the coroutine is not scheduled with\n",
    "`asyncio.create_task`, asyncio will emit a `RuntimeWarning`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "    async def test():\n",
    "        print(\"never scheduled\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    async def main():\n",
    "        test()\n",
    "\n",
    "    asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    test.py:7: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'test' was never awaited\n",
    "      test()\n",
    "\n",
    "Output in debug mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "    test.py:7: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'test' was never awaited\n",
    "    Coroutine created at (most recent call last)\n",

    "        test()\n",
    "      test()\n",

    "## Detect never-retrieved exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "If a `Future.set_exception` is called but the Future object is never\n",
    "awaited on, the exception would never be propagated to the user code. In\n",
    "this case, asyncio would emit a log message when the Future object is\n",
