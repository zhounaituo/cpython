    "This module implements a helper class and functions to quickly write a\n",
    "loop over standard input or a list of files. If you just want to read or\n",
    "write one file see `open`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical use is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import fileinput\n",
    "    for line in fileinput.input(encoding=\"utf-8\"):\n",
    "        process(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterates over the lines of all files listed in `sys.argv[1:]`,\n",
    "defaulting to `sys.stdin` if the list is empty. If a filename is `'-'`,\n",
    "it is also replaced by `sys.stdin` and the optional arguments *mode* and\n",
    "*openhook* are ignored. To specify an alternative list of filenames,\n",
    "pass it as the first argument to `.input`. A single file name is also\n",
    "allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "All files are opened in text mode by default, but you can override this\n",
    "by specifying the *mode* parameter in the call to `.input` or\n",
    "`FileInput`. If an I/O error occurs during opening or reading a file,\n",
    "`OSError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 `IOError` used to be raised; it is now an alias of `OSError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `sys.stdin` is used more than once, the second and further use will\n",
    "return no lines, except perhaps for interactive use, or if it has been\n",
    "explicitly reset (e.g. using `sys.stdin.seek(0)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty files are opened and immediately closed; the only time their\n",
    "presence in the list of filenames is noticeable at all is when the last\n",
    "file opened is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines are returned with any newlines intact, which means that the last\n",
    "line in a file may not have one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control how files are opened by providing an opening hook via\n",
    "the *openhook* parameter to `fileinput.input` or `FileInput()`. The hook\n",
    "must be a function that takes two arguments, *filename* and *mode*, and\n",
    "returns an accordingly opened file-like object. If *encoding* and/or\n",
    "*errors* are specified, they will be passed to the hook as additional\n",
