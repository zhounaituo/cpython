    "A \"shelf\" is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with\n",
    "\"dbm\" databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be\n",
    "essentially arbitrary Python objects --- anything that the `pickle`\n",
    "module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data\n",
    "types, and objects containing lots of shared sub-objects. The keys are\n",
    "ordinary strings.\n",

    "Open a persistent dictionary. The filename specified is the base\n",
    "filename for the underlying database. As a side-effect, an extension may\n",
    "be added to the filename and more than one file may be created. By\n",
    "default, the underlying database file is opened for reading and writing.\n",
    "The optional *flag* parameter has the same interpretation as the *flag*\n",
    "parameter of `dbm.open`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, pickles created with `pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` are used to\n",
    "serialize values. The version of the pickle protocol can be specified\n",
    "with the *protocol* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of Python semantics, a shelf cannot know when a mutable\n",
    "persistent-dictionary entry is modified. By default modified objects are\n",
    "written *only* when assigned to the shelf (see `shelve-example`). If the\n",
    "optional *writeback* parameter is set to `True`, all entries accessed\n",
    "are also cached in memory, and written back on `~Shelf.sync` and\n",
    "`~Shelf.close`; this can make it handier to mutate mutable entries in\n",
    "the persistent dictionary, but, if many entries are accessed, it can\n",
    "consume vast amounts of memory for the cache, and it can make the close\n",
    "operation very slow since all accessed entries are written back (there\n",
    "is no way to determine which accessed entries are mutable, nor which\n",
    "ones were actually mutated).\n",

    "> module: dbm.ndbm module: dbm.gnu\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The choice of which database package will be used (such as\n",
    "    `dbm.ndbm` or `dbm.gnu`) depends on which interface is available.\n",
    "    Therefore it is not safe to open the database directly using `dbm`.\n",
    "    The database is also (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of\n",
    "    `dbm`, if it is used ---this means that (the pickled representation\n",
    "    of) the objects stored in the database should be fairly small, and\n",
    "    in rare cases key collisions may cause the database to refuse\n",
    "    updates.\n",
    "-   The `shelve` module does not support *concurrent* read/write access\n",
    "    to shelved objects. (Multiple simultaneous read accesses are safe.)\n",
    "    When a program has a shelf open for writing, no other program should\n",
    "    have it open for reading or writing. Unix file locking can be used\n",
    "    to solve this, but this differs across Unix versions and requires\n",
    "    knowledge about the database implementation used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subclass of `collections.abc.MutableMapping` which stores pickled\n",
    "values in the *dict* object.\n",

    "By default, pickles created with `pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL` are used to\n",
    "serialize values. The version of the pickle protocol can be specified\n",
    "with the *protocol* parameter. See the `pickle` documentation for a\n",
    "discussion of the pickle protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the *writeback* parameter is `True`, the object will hold a cache of\n",
    "all entries accessed and write them back to the *dict* at sync and close\n",
    "times. This allows natural operations on mutable entries, but can\n",
    "consume much more memory and make sync and close take a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *keyencoding* parameter is the encoding used to encode keys before\n",
    "they are used with the underlying dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Shelf` object can also be used as a context manager, in which case it\n",
    "will be automatically closed when the `with` block ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Added the *keyencoding* parameter; previously, keys were always\n",
    "encoded in UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 Added context manager support.\n",

    "and `set_location` which are available in the third-party `bsddb` module\n",
    "from [pybsddb](https://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm) but not in\n",
    "other database modules. The *dict* object passed to the constructor must\n",
    "support those methods. This is generally accomplished by calling one of\n",
    "`bsddb.hashopen`, `bsddb.btopen` or `bsddb.rnopen`. The optional\n",

    "A subclass of `Shelf` which accepts a *filename* instead of a dict-like\n",
    "object. The underlying file will be opened using `dbm.open`. By default,\n",
    "the file will be created and opened for both read and write. The\n",
