    "a composition window manager on X11).\n",

    "## Using Ttk\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using Ttk, import its module:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from tkinter import ttk\n",
    "\n",
    "To override the basic Tk widgets, the import should follow the Tk\n",
    "import:\n",

    "    from tkinter import *\n",
    "    from tkinter.ttk import *\n",
    "\n",
    "That code causes several `tkinter.ttk` widgets (`Button`, `Checkbutton`,\n",
    "`Entry`, `Frame`, `Label`, `LabelFrame`, `Menubutton`, `PanedWindow`,\n",
    "`Radiobutton`, `Scale` and `Scrollbar`) to automatically replace the Tk\n",
    "widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the direct benefit of using the new widgets which gives a\n",
    "better look and feel across platforms; however, the replacement widgets\n",
    "are not completely compatible. The main difference is that widget\n",
    "options such as \"fg\", \"bg\" and others related to widget styling are no\n",
    "longer present in Ttk widgets. Instead, use the `ttk.Style` class for\n",

    "## Ttk Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "Ttk comes with 18 widgets, twelve of which already existed in tkinter:\n",
    "`Button`, `Checkbutton`, `Entry`, `Frame`, `Label`, `LabelFrame`,\n",

The class is used when querying the option database for the window's other options, to determine the default bindtags for the window, and to select the widget's default layout and style. This option is read-only, and may only be specified when the window is created.                                                                                                                        |\n",

    "> | takefocus | Determines whether the window accepts the focus during keyboard traversal. 0, 1 or an empty string is returned. If 0 is returned, it means that the window should be skipped entirely during keyboard traversal. If 1, it means that the window should receive the input focus as long as it is viewable. And an empty string means that the traversal scripts make the decision about whether or not to focus on the window. |\n",
    "> | style     | May be used to specify a custom widget style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",
