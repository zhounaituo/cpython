    "A Modular Crypt Format method with 16 character salt and 86 character\n",

    "The traditional method with a 2 character salt and 13 characters of\n",

    "## Module Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of available password hashing algorithms, as `crypt.METHOD_*`\n",
    "objects. This list is sorted from strongest to weakest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `crypt` module defines the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "crypt(word, salt=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "*word* will usually be a user's password as typed at a prompt or in a\n",
    "graphical interface. The optional *salt* is either a string as returned\n",
    "from `mksalt`, one of the `crypt.METHOD_*` values (though not all may be\n",
    "available on all platforms), or a full encrypted password including\n",
    "salt, as returned by this function. If *salt* is not provided, the\n",
    "strongest method available in `methods` will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking a password is usually done by passing the plain-text password\n",
    "as *word* and the full results of a previous `crypt` call, which should\n",
    "be the same as the results of this call.\n",
    "\n",
    "*salt* (either a random 2 or 16 character string, possibly prefixed with\n",
    "`$digit$` to indicate the method) which will be used to perturb the\n",
    "encryption algorithm. The characters in *salt* must be in the set\n",
    "`[./a-zA-Z0-9]`, with the exception of Modular Crypt Format which\n",
    "prefixes a `$digit$`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns the hashed password as a string, which will be composed of\n",
    "characters from the same alphabet as the salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: crypt(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a few `crypt(3)` extensions allow different values, with different\n",
    "sizes in the *salt*, it is recommended to use the full crypted password\n",
    "as salt when checking for a password.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Accept `crypt.METHOD_*` values in addition to strings for *salt*.\n",
    "\n",
    "mksalt(method=None, \\*, rounds=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a randomly generated salt of the specified method. If no *method*\n",
    "is given, the strongest method available in `methods` is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is a string suitable for passing as the *salt* argument\n",
    "to `crypt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*rounds* specifies the number of rounds for `METHOD_SHA256`,\n",
    "`METHOD_SHA512` and `METHOD_BLOWFISH`. For `METHOD_SHA256` and\n",
    "`METHOD_SHA512` it must be an integer between `1000` and `999_999_999`,\n",
    "the default is `5000`. For `METHOD_BLOWFISH` it must be a power of two\n",
    "between `16` (2<sup>4</sup>) and `2_147_483_648` (2<sup>31</sup>), the\n",
    "default is `4096` (2<sup>12</sup>).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 Added the *rounds* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example illustrating typical use (a constant-time comparison\n",
    "operation is needed to limit exposure to timing attacks.\n",
    "`hmac.compare_digest` is suitable for this purpose):\n",
