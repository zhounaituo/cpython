    "functionality, see also the `datetime` and `calendar` modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this module is always available, not all functions are\n",
    "available on all platforms. Most of the functions defined in this module\n",
    "call platform C library functions with the same name. It may sometimes\n",
    "be helpful to consult the platform documentation, because the semantics\n",
    "of these functions varies among platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "An explanation of some terminology and conventions is in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `epoch` is the point where the time starts, the return value of\n",
    "    `time.gmtime(0)`. It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all\n",
    "    platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "seconds since the epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The term `seconds since the epoch` refers to the total number of\n",
    "    elapsed seconds since the epoch, typically excluding [leap\n",
    "    seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second). Leap seconds\n",
    "    are excluded from this total on all POSIX-compliant platforms.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-   The functions in this module may not handle dates and times before\n",
    "    the [epoch](#epoch) or far in the future. The cut-off point in the\n",
    "    future is determined by the C library; for 32-bit systems, it is\n",

    "    the POSIX and ISO C standards: values 69--99 are mapped to\n",
    "    1969--1999, and values 0--68 are mapped to 2000--2068.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: UTC single: Coordinated Universal Time single: Greenwich Mean\n",
    "Time\n",
    "\n",
    "-   UTC is Coordinated Universal Time (formerly known as Greenwich Mean\n",
    "    Time, or GMT). The acronym UTC is not a mistake but a compromise\n",
    "    between English and French.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: Daylight Saving Time\n",
    "\n",
    "-   DST is Daylight Saving Time, an adjustment of the timezone by\n",
    "    (usually) one hour during part of the year. DST rules are magic\n",
    "    (determined by local law) and can change from year to year. The C\n",
    "    library has a table containing the local rules (often it is read\n",
    "    from a system file for flexibility) and is the only source of True\n",
    "    Wisdom in this respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The precision of the various real-time functions may be less than\n",
    "    suggested by the units in which their value or argument is\n",
    "    expressed. E.g. on most Unix systems, the clock \"ticks\" only 50 or\n",
    "    100 times a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   On the other hand, the precision of `.time` and `sleep` is better\n",
    "    than their Unix equivalents: times are expressed as floating point\n",
    "    numbers, `.time` returns the most accurate time available (using\n",
    "    Unix :c`gettimeofday` where available), and `sleep` will accept a\n",
    "    time with a nonzero fraction (Unix :c`select` is used to implement\n",
    "    this, where available).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The time value as returned by `gmtime`, `localtime`, and `strptime`,\n",
    "    and accepted by `asctime`, `mktime` and `strftime`, is a sequence of\n",
    "    9 integers. The return values of `gmtime`, `localtime`, and\n",
