    "# `signal` --- Set handlers for asynchronous events\n",
    "\n",
    "signal\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This module provides mechanisms to use signal handlers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The `signal.signal` function allows defining custom handlers to be\n",
    "executed when a signal is received. A small number of default handlers\n",
    "are installed: `SIGPIPE` is ignored (so write errors on pipes and\n",
    "sockets can be reported as ordinary Python exceptions) and `SIGINT` is\n",
    "translated into a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception if the parent process\n",
    "has not changed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handler for a particular signal, once set, remains installed until it\n",
    "is explicitly reset (Python emulates the BSD style interface regardless\n",
    "of the underlying implementation), with the exception of the handler for\n",
    "`SIGCHLD`, which follows the underlying implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution of Python signal handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python signal handler does not get executed inside the low-level (C)\n",
    "signal handler. Instead, the low-level signal handler sets a flag which\n",
    "tells the `virtual machine` to execute the corresponding Python signal\n",
    "handler at a later point(for example at the next `bytecode`\n",
    "instruction). This has consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It makes little sense to catch synchronous errors like `SIGFPE` or\n",
    "    `SIGSEGV` that are caused by an invalid operation in C code. Python\n",
    "    will return from the signal handler to the C code, which is likely\n",
    "    to raise the same signal again, causing Python to apparently hang.\n",
    "    From Python 3.3 onwards, you can use the `faulthandler` module to\n",
    "    report on synchronous errors.\n",
    "-   A long-running calculation implemented purely in C (such as regular\n",
    "    expression matching on a large body of text) may run uninterrupted\n",
    "    for an arbitrary amount of time, regardless of any signals received.\n",
    "    The Python signal handlers will be called when the calculation\n",
    "    finishes.\n",
    "-   If the handler raises an exception, it will be raised \"out of thin\n",
    "    air\" in the main thread. See the\n",
    "    `note below <handlers-and-exceptions>` for a discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signals and threads\n",
    "\n",
    "Python signal handlers are always executed in the main Python thread of\n",
    "the main interpreter, even if the signal was received in another thread.\n",
    "This means that signals can't be used as a means of inter-thread\n",
    "communication. You can use the synchronization primitives from the\n",
    "`threading` module instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, only the main thread of the main interpreter is allowed to set\n",
    "a new signal handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module contents\n",
