    "### Supporting a variable number of context managers\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary use case for `ExitStack` is the one given in the class\n",
    "documentation: supporting a variable number of context managers and\n",
    "other cleanup operations in a single `with` statement. The variability\n",
    "may come from the number of context managers needed being driven by user\n",
    "input (such as opening a user specified collection of files), or from\n",
    "some of the context managers being optional:\n",
    "\n",
    "    with ExitStack() as stack:\n",
    "        for resource in resources:\n",

    "As shown, `ExitStack` also makes it quite easy to use `with` statements\n",
    "to manage arbitrary resources that don't natively support the context\n",
    "management protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Catching exceptions from `__enter__` methods\n",
    "\n",
    "It is occasionally desirable to catch exceptions from an `__enter__`\n",

    "        with stack:\n",
    "            # Handle normal case\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually needing to do this is likely to indicate that the underlying\n",
    "API should be providing a direct resource management interface for use\n",
    "with `try`/`except`/`finally` statements, but not all APIs are well\n",
    "designed in that regard. When a context manager is the only resource\n",
    "management API provided, then `ExitStack` can make it easier to handle\n",
