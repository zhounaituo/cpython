    "This section describes the API for configuring the logging module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following functions configure the logging module. They are located\n",
    "in the `logging.config` module. Their use is optional --- you can\n",
    "configure the logging module using these functions or by making calls to\n",
    "the main API (defined in `logging` itself) and defining handlers which\n",
    "are declared either in `logging` or `logging.handlers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "dictConfig(config)\n",
    "\n",
    "Takes the logging configuration from a dictionary. The contents of this\n",
    "dictionary are described in `logging-config-dictschema` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an error is encountered during configuration, this function will\n",
    "raise a `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `AttributeError` or `ImportError`\n",
    "with a suitably descriptive message. The following is a (possibly\n",
    "incomplete) list of conditions which will raise an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A `level` which is not a string or which is a string not\n",
    "    corresponding to an actual logging level.\n",
    "-   A `propagate` value which is not a boolean.\n",
    "-   An id which does not have a corresponding destination.\n",
    "-   A non-existent handler id found during an incremental call.\n",
    "-   An invalid logger name.\n",
    "-   Inability to resolve to an internal or external object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing is performed by the `DictConfigurator` class, whose constructor\n",
    "is passed the dictionary used for configuration, and has a `configure`\n",
    "method. The `logging.config` module has a callable attribute\n",
    "`dictConfigClass` which is initially set to `DictConfigurator`. You can\n",
    "replace the value of `dictConfigClass` with a suitable implementation of\n",
    "your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "`dictConfig` calls `dictConfigClass` passing the specified dictionary,\n",
    "and then calls the `configure` method on the returned object to put the\n",
    "configuration into effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def dictConfig(config):\n",
    "        dictConfigClass(config).configure()\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a subclass of `DictConfigurator` could call\n",
    "`DictConfigurator.__init__()` in its own `__init__()`, then set up\n",
    "custom prefixes which would be usable in the subsequent `configure`\n",
    "call. `dictConfigClass` would be bound to this new subclass, and then\n",
    "`dictConfig` could be called exactly as in the default, uncustomized\n",

    "Reads the logging configuration from a `configparser`-format file. The\n",
    "format of the file should be as described in\n",
    "`logging-config-fileformat`. This function can be called several times\n",

    "pre-canned configurations (if the developer provides a mechanism to\n",

    "A filename, or a file-like object, or an instance derived from\n",

    "is passed, it is used as is. Otherwise, a `~configparser.Configparser`\n",
    "is instantiated, and the configuration read by it from the object passed\n",
    "in `fname`. If that has a `readline` method, it is assumed to be a\n",
    "file-like object and read using `~configparser.ConfigParser.read_file`;\n",
    "otherwise, it is assumed to be a filename and passed to\n",
    "`~configparser.ConfigParser.read`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `verify` argument, if specified, should be a callable which should\n",
    "verify whether bytes received across the socket are valid and should be\n",
    "processed. This could be done by encrypting and/or signing what is sent\n",
    "across the socket, such that the `verify` callable can perform signature\n",
    "verification and/or decryption. The `verify` callable is called with a\n",
    "single argument - the bytes received across the socket - and should\n",
    "return the bytes to be processed, or `None` to indicate that the bytes\n",
    "should be discarded. The returned bytes could be the same as the passed\n",
    "in bytes (e.g. when only verification is done), or they could be\n",
    "completely different (perhaps if decryption were performed).\n",
    "\n",
    "To send a configuration to the socket, read in the configuration file\n",
    "and send it to the socket as a sequence of bytes preceded by a four-byte\n",
    "length string packed in binary using `struct.pack('>L', n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Because portions of the configuration are passed through `eval`, use of\n",
    "this function may open its users to a security risk. While the function\n",
    "only binds to a socket on `localhost`, and so does not accept\n",
    "connections from remote machines, there are scenarios where untrusted\n",
    "code could be run under the account of the process which calls `listen`.\n",
    "Specifically, if the process calling `listen` runs on a multi-user\n",
    "machine where users cannot trust each other, then a malicious user could\n",
    "arrange to run essentially arbitrary code in a victim user's process,\n",
    "simply by connecting to the victim's `listen` socket and sending a\n",
    "configuration which runs whatever code the attacker wants to have\n",
    "executed in the victim's process. This is especially easy to do if the\n",
    "default port is used, but not hard even if a different port is used. To\n",
    "avoid the risk of this happening, use the `verify` argument to `listen`\n",
    "to prevent unrecognised configurations from being applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 The `verify` argument was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to send configurations to the listener which don't disable\n",
    "existing loggers, you will need to use a JSON format for the\n",
    "configuration, which will use `dictConfig` for configuration. This\n",
    "method allows you to specify `disable_existing_loggers` as `False` in\n",

    "Stops the listening server which was created with a call to `listen`.\n",
    "This is typically called before calling `join` on the return value from\n",
    "`listen`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging configuration functionality tries to offer convenience, and\n",
    "in part this is done by offering the ability to convert text in\n",
    "configuration files into Python objects used in logging configuration -\n",
    "for example, as described in `logging-config-dict-userdef`. However,\n",
    "these same mechanisms (importing callables from user-defined modules and\n",
    "calling them with parameters from the configuration) could be used to\n",
    "invoke any code you like, and for this reason you should treat\n",
    "configuration files from untrusted sources with *extreme caution* and\n",
    "satisfy yourself that nothing bad can happen if you load them, before\n",
    "actually loading them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration dictionary schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Describing a logging configuration requires listing the various objects\n",
    "to create and the connections between them; for example, you may create\n",
    "a handler named 'console' and then say that the logger named 'startup'\n",
    "will send its messages to the 'console' handler. These objects aren't\n",
    "limited to those provided by the `logging` module because you might\n",
    "write your own formatter or handler class. The parameters to these\n",
    "classes may also need to include external objects such as `sys.stderr`.\n",
    "The syntax for describing these objects and connections is defined in\n",
    "`logging-config-dict-connections` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Schema Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary passed to `dictConfig` must contain the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *version* - to be set to an integer value representing the schema\n",
    "    version. The only valid value at present is 1, but having this key\n",
    "    allows the schema to evolve while still preserving backwards\n",
    "    compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other keys are optional, but if present they will be interpreted as\n",
    "described below. In all cases below where a 'configuring dict' is\n",
    "mentioned, it will be checked for the special `'()'` key to see if a\n",
    "custom instantiation is required. If so, the mechanism described in\n",
    "`logging-config-dict-userdef` below is used to create an instance;\n",
    "otherwise, the context is used to determine what to instantiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *formatters* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each\n",
    "    key is a formatter id and each value is a dict describing how to\n",
    "    configure the corresponding `~logging.Formatter` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The configuring dict is searched for the following optional keys\n",
    "    which correspond to the arguments passed to create a\n",
    "    `~logging.Formatter` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    > -   `format`\n",
    "    > -   `datefmt`\n",
    "    > -   `style`\n",
    "    > -   `validate` (since version \\>=3.8)\n",
    "\n",
    "    An optional `class` key indicates the name of the formatter's class\n",
    "    (as a dotted module and class name). The instantiation arguments are\n",
    "    as for `~logging.Formatter`, thus this key is most useful for\n",
    "    instantiating a customised subclass of `~logging.Formatter`. For\n",
    "    example, the alternative class might present exception tracebacks in\n",
    "    an expanded or condensed format. If your formatter requires\n",
    "    different or extra configuration keys, you should use\n",
    "    `logging-config-dict-userdef`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *filters* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each key\n",
    "    is a filter id and each value is a dict describing how to configure\n",
    "    the corresponding Filter instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The configuring dict is searched for the key `name` (defaulting to\n",
    "    the empty string) and this is used to construct a `logging.Filter`\n",
    "    instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *handlers* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each\n",
    "    key is a handler id and each value is a dict describing how to\n",
    "    configure the corresponding Handler instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The configuring dict is searched for the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `class` (mandatory). This is the fully qualified name of the\n",
    "        handler class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `level` (optional). The level of the handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `formatter` (optional). The id of the formatter for this\n",
    "        handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `filters` (optional). A list of ids of the filters for this\n",
    "        handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3.11 `filters` can take filter instances in addition to ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "    All *other* keys are passed through as keyword arguments to the\n",
    "    handler's constructor. For example, given the snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` yaml\n",
    "    handlers:\n",
    "      console:\n",
    "        class : logging.StreamHandler\n",
    "        formatter: brief\n",
    "        level   : INFO\n",
    "        filters: [allow_foo]\n",
    "        stream  : ext://sys.stdout\n",
    "      file:\n",
    "        class : logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler\n",
    "        formatter: precise\n",
    "        filename: logconfig.log\n",
    "        maxBytes: 1024\n",
    "        backupCount: 3\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    the handler with id `console` is instantiated as a\n",
    "    `logging.StreamHandler`, using `sys.stdout` as the underlying\n",
    "    stream. The handler with id `file` is instantiated as a\n",
    "    `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` with the keyword arguments\n",
    "    `filename='logconfig.log', maxBytes=1024, backupCount=3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *loggers* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each key\n",
    "    is a logger name and each value is a dict describing how to\n",
    "    configure the corresponding Logger instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The configuring dict is searched for the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `level` (optional). The level of the logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `propagate` (optional). The propagation setting of the logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `filters` (optional). A list of ids of the filters for this\n",
    "        logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3.11 `filters` can take filter instances in addition to ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `handlers` (optional). A list of ids of the handlers for this\n",
    "        logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The specified loggers will be configured according to the level,\n",
    "    propagation, filters and handlers specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *root* - this will be the configuration for the root logger.\n",
    "    Processing of the configuration will be as for any logger, except\n",
    "    that the `propagate` setting will not be applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *incremental* - whether the configuration is to be interpreted as\n",
    "    incremental to the existing configuration. This value defaults to\n",
    "    `False`, which means that the specified configuration replaces the\n",
    "    existing configuration with the same semantics as used by the\n",
    "    existing `fileConfig` API.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the specified value is `True`, the configuration is processed as\n",
    "    described in the section on `logging-config-dict-incremental`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *disable_existing_loggers* - whether any existing non-root loggers\n",
    "    are to be disabled. This setting mirrors the parameter of the same\n",
    "    name in `fileConfig`. If absent, this parameter defaults to `True`.\n",
    "    This value is ignored if *incremental* is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incremental Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to provide complete flexibility for incremental\n",
    "configuration. For example, because objects such as filters and\n",
    "formatters are anonymous, once a configuration is set up, it is not\n",
    "possible to refer to such anonymous objects when augmenting a\n",
    "configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there is not a compelling case for arbitrarily altering the\n",
    "object graph of loggers, handlers, filters, formatters at run-time, once\n",
    "a configuration is set up; the verbosity of loggers and handlers can be\n",
    "controlled just by setting levels (and, in the case of loggers,\n",
    "propagation flags). Changing the object graph arbitrarily in a safe way\n",
    "is problematic in a multi-threaded environment; while not impossible,\n",
    "the benefits are not worth the complexity it adds to the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when the `incremental` key of a configuration dict is present and\n",
    "is `True`, the system will completely ignore any `formatters` and\n",
    "`filters` entries, and process only the `level` settings in the\n",
    "`handlers` entries, and the `level` and `propagate` settings in the\n",
    "`loggers` and `root` entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a value in the configuration dict lets configurations to be sent\n",
    "over the wire as pickled dicts to a socket listener. Thus, the logging\n",
    "verbosity of a long-running application can be altered over time with no\n",
    "need to stop and restart the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object connections\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema describes a set of logging objects - loggers, handlers,\n",
    "formatters, filters - which are connected to each other in an object\n",
    "graph. Thus, the schema needs to represent connections between the\n",
    "objects. For example, say that, once configured, a particular logger has\n",
    "attached to it a particular handler. For the purposes of this\n",
    "discussion, we can say that the logger represents the source, and the\n",
    "handler the destination, of a connection between the two. Of course in\n",
    "the configured objects this is represented by the logger holding a\n",
    "reference to the handler. In the configuration dict, this is done by\n",
    "giving each destination object an id which identifies it unambiguously,\n",
    "and then using the id in the source object's configuration to indicate\n",
    "that a connection exists between the source and the destination object\n",
    "with that id.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, consider the following YAML snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "formatters:\n",
    "  brief:\n",
    "    # configuration for formatter with id 'brief' goes here\n",
    "  precise:\n",
    "    # configuration for formatter with id 'precise' goes here\n",
    "handlers:\n",
    "  h1: #This is an id\n",
    "   # configuration of handler with id 'h1' goes here\n",
    "   formatter: brief\n",
    "  h2: #This is another id\n",
    "   # configuration of handler with id 'h2' goes here\n",
    "   formatter: precise\n",
    "loggers:\n",
    "  foo.bar.baz:\n",
    "    # other configuration for logger 'foo.bar.baz'\n",
    "    handlers: [h1, h2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: YAML used here because it's a little more readable than the\n",
    "equivalent Python source form for the dictionary.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ids for loggers are the logger names which would be used\n",
    "programmatically to obtain a reference to those loggers, e.g.\n",
    "`foo.bar.baz`. The ids for Formatters and Filters can be any string\n",
    "value (such as `brief`, `precise` above) and they are transient, in that\n",
    "they are only meaningful for processing the configuration dictionary and\n",
    "used to determine connections between objects, and are not persisted\n",
    "anywhere when the configuration call is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above snippet indicates that logger named `foo.bar.baz` should have\n",
    "two handlers attached to it, which are described by the handler ids `h1`\n",
    "and `h2`. The formatter for `h1` is that described by id `brief`, and\n",
    "the formatter for `h2` is that described by id `precise`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-defined objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema supports user-defined objects for handlers, filters and\n",
    "formatters. (Loggers do not need to have different types for different\n",
    "instances, so there is no support in this configuration schema for\n",
    "user-defined logger classes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects to be configured are described by dictionaries which detail\n",
    "their configuration. In some places, the logging system will be able to\n",
    "infer from the context how an object is to be instantiated, but when a\n",
    "user-defined object is to be instantiated, the system will not know how\n",
    "to do this. In order to provide complete flexibility for user-defined\n",
    "object instantiation, the user needs to provide a 'factory' - a callable\n",
    "which is called with a configuration dictionary and which returns the\n",
    "instantiated object. This is signalled by an absolute import path to the\n",
    "factory being made available under the special key `'()'`. Here's a\n",
    "concrete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "formatters:\n",
    "  brief:\n",
    "    format: '%(message)s'\n",
    "  default:\n",
    "    format: '%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(name)-15s %(message)s'\n",
    "    datefmt: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'\n",
    "  custom:\n",
    "      (): my.package.customFormatterFactory\n",
    "      bar: baz\n",
    "      spam: 99.9\n",
    "      answer: 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above YAML snippet defines three formatters. The first, with id\n",
    "`brief`, is a standard `logging.Formatter` instance with the specified\n",
    "format string. The second, with id `default`, has a longer format and\n",
    "also defines the time format explicitly, and will result in a\n",
    "`logging.Formatter` initialized with those two format strings. Shown in\n",

    "      'bar' : 'baz',\n",

    "      'answer' : 42\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "and this contains the special key `'()'`, which means that user-defined\n",
    "instantiation is wanted. In this case, the specified factory callable\n",
    "will be used. If it is an actual callable it will be used directly -\n",
    "otherwise, if you specify a string (as in the example) the actual\n",
    "callable will be located using normal import mechanisms. The callable\n",

    "\n",
    "    my.package.customFormatterFactory(bar='baz', spam=99.9, answer=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key `'()'` has been used as the special key because it is not a\n",
    "valid keyword parameter name, and so will not clash with the names of\n",
    "the keyword arguments used in the call. The `'()'` also serves as a\n",

    "\n",
    "### Access to external objects\n",
    "\n",
    "There are times where a configuration needs to refer to objects external\n",
    "to the configuration, for example `sys.stderr`. If the configuration\n",
    "dict is constructed using Python code, this is straightforward, but a\n",
    "problem arises when the configuration is provided via a text file (e.g.\n",
    "JSON, YAML). In a text file, there is no standard way to distinguish\n",
    "`sys.stderr` from the literal string `'sys.stderr'`. To facilitate this\n",
    "distinction, the configuration system looks for certain special prefixes\n",
    "in string values and treat them specially. For example, if the literal\n",
    "string `'ext://sys.stderr'` is provided as a value in the configuration,\n",
    "then the `ext://` will be stripped off and the remainder of the value\n",
    "processed using normal import mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The handling of such prefixes is done in a way analogous to protocol\n",
    "handling: there is a generic mechanism to look for prefixes which match\n",
    "the regular expression `^(?P<prefix>[a-z]+)://(?P<suffix>.*)$` whereby,\n",
    "if the `prefix` is recognised, the `suffix` is processed in a\n",
    "prefix-dependent manner and the result of the processing replaces the\n",
    "string value. If the prefix is not recognised, then the string value\n",
    "will be left as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access to internal objects\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as external objects, there is sometimes also a need to refer to\n",
    "objects in the configuration. This will be done implicitly by the\n",
    "configuration system for things that it knows about. For example, the\n",
    "string value `'DEBUG'` for a `level` in a logger or handler will\n",
    "automatically be converted to the value `logging.DEBUG`, and the\n",
    "`handlers`, `filters` and `formatter` entries will take an object id and\n",
    "resolve to the appropriate destination object.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a more generic mechanism is needed for user-defined objects\n",
    "which are not known to the `logging` module. For example, consider\n",
    "`logging.handlers.MemoryHandler`, which takes a `target` argument which\n",
    "is another handler to delegate to. Since the system already knows about\n",
    "this class, then in the configuration, the given `target` just needs to\n",
    "be the object id of the relevant target handler, and the system will\n",
    "resolve to the handler from the id. If, however, a user defines a\n",
    "`my.package.MyHandler` which has an `alternate` handler, the\n",
    "configuration system would not know that the `alternate` referred to a\n",
    "handler. To cater for this, a generic resolution system allows the user\n",
    "to specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "handlers:\n",
    "  file:\n",
    "    # configuration of file handler goes here\n",
    "\n",
    "  custom:\n",
    "    (): my.package.MyHandler\n",
    "    alternate: cfg://handlers.file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The literal string `'cfg://handlers.file'` will be resolved in an\n",
    "analogous way to strings with the `ext://` prefix, but looking in the\n",
    "configuration itself rather than the import namespace. The mechanism\n",
    "allows access by dot or by index, in a similar way to that provided by\n",
    "`str.format`. Thus, given the following snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "handlers:\n",
    "  email:\n",
    "    class: logging.handlers.SMTPHandler\n",
    "    mailhost: localhost\n",
    "    fromaddr: my_app@domain.tld\n",
    "    toaddrs:\n",
    "      - support_team@domain.tld\n",
    "      - dev_team@domain.tld\n",
    "    subject: Houston, we have a problem.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in the configuration, the string `'cfg://handlers'` would resolve to the\n",
    "dict with key `handlers`, the string `'cfg://handlers.email` would\n",
    "resolve to the dict with key `email` in the `handlers` dict, and so on.\n",
    "The string `'cfg://handlers.email.toaddrs[1]` would resolve to\n",
    "`'dev_team@domain.tld'` and the string\n",
    "`'cfg://handlers.email.toaddrs[0]'` would resolve to the value\n",
    "`'support_team@domain.tld'`. The `subject` value could be accessed using\n",
    "either `'cfg://handlers.email.subject'` or, equivalently,\n",
    "`'cfg://handlers.email[subject]'`. The latter form only needs to be used\n",
    "if the key contains spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. If an index\n",
    "value consists only of decimal digits, access will be attempted using\n",
    "the corresponding integer value, falling back to the string value if\n",
    "needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string `cfg://handlers.myhandler.mykey.123`, this will resolve\n",
    "to `config_dict['handlers']['myhandler']['mykey']['123']`. If the string\n",
    "is specified as `cfg://handlers.myhandler.mykey[123]`, the system will\n",
    "attempt to retrieve the value from\n",
    "`config_dict['handlers']['myhandler']['mykey'][123]`, and fall back to\n",
    "`config_dict['handlers']['myhandler']['mykey']['123']` if that fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import resolution and custom importers\n",
    "\n",
    "Import resolution, by default, uses the builtin `__import__` function to\n",
    "do its importing. You may want to replace this with your own importing\n",
    "mechanism: if so, you can replace the `importer` attribute of the\n",
    "`DictConfigurator` or its superclass, the `BaseConfigurator` class.\n",
    "However, you need to be careful because of the way functions are\n",
    "accessed from classes via descriptors. If you are using a Python\n",
    "callable to do your imports, and you want to define it at class level\n",
    "rather than instance level, you need to wrap it with `staticmethod`. For\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from importlib import import_module\n",
    "    from logging.config import BaseConfigurator\n",
    "\n",
    "    BaseConfigurator.importer = staticmethod(import_module)\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to wrap with `staticmethod` if you're setting the import\n",
    "callable on a configurator *instance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration file format\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration file format understood by `fileConfig` is based on\n",
    "`configparser` functionality. The file must contain sections called\n",
    "`[loggers]`, `[handlers]` and `[formatters]` which identify by name the\n",
    "entities of each type which are defined in the file. For each such\n",
    "entity, there is a separate section which identifies how that entity is\n",
    "configured. Thus, for a logger named `log01` in the `[loggers]` section,\n",
    "the relevant configuration details are held in a section\n",
    "`[logger_log01]`. Similarly, a handler called `hand01` in the\n",
    "`[handlers]` section will have its configuration held in a section\n",
    "called `[handler_hand01]`, while a formatter called `form01` in the\n",
    "`[formatters]` section will have its configuration specified in a\n",
    "section called `[formatter_form01]`. The root logger configuration must\n",
    "be specified in a section called `[logger_root]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fileConfig` API is older than the `dictConfig` API and does not\n",
    "provide functionality to cover certain aspects of logging. For example,\n",
    "you cannot configure `~logging.Filter` objects, which provide for\n",
    "filtering of messages beyond simple integer levels, using `fileConfig`.\n",
    "If you need to have instances of `~logging.Filter` in your logging\n",
    "configuration, you will need to use `dictConfig`. Note that future\n",
    "enhancements to configuration functionality will be added to\n",
    "`dictConfig`, so it's worth considering transitioning to this newer API\n",
    "when it's convenient to do so.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The `handlers` entry is a comma-separated list of handler names, which\n",

    "configuration file.\n",
    "\n",

    "determine the effective level of the logger. The `propagate` entry is\n",
    "set to 1 to indicate that messages must propagate to handlers higher up\n",
    "the logger hierarchy from this logger, or 0 to indicate that messages\n",
