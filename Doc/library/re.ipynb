    "\n",
    "This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to\n",
    "those found in Perl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (`str`)\n",
    "as well as 8-bit strings (`bytes`). However, Unicode strings and 8-bit\n",
    "strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode string with\n",
    "a byte pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a substitution,\n",
    "the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and\n",
    "the search string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions use the backslash character (`'\\'`) to indicate\n",
    "special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking\n",
    "their special meaning. This collides with Python's usage of the same\n",
    "character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match\n",
    "a literal backslash, one might have to write `'\\\\\\\\'` as the pattern\n",
    "string, because the regular expression must be `\\\\`, and each backslash\n",
    "must be expressed as `\\\\` inside a regular Python string literal. Also,\n",
    "please note that any invalid escape sequences in Python's usage of the\n",
    "backslash in string literals now generate a `DeprecationWarning` and in\n",
    "the future this will become a `SyntaxError`. This behaviour will happen\n",
    "even if it is a valid escape sequence for a regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use Python's raw string notation for regular\n",
    "expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a\n",
    "string literal prefixed with `'r'`. So `r\"\\n\"` is a two-character string\n",
    "containing `'\\'` and `'n'`, while `\"\\n\"` is a one-character string\n",
    "containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code\n",
    "using this raw string notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that most regular expression operations are\n",
    "available as module-level functions and methods on\n",
    "`compiled regular expressions <re-objects>`. The functions are shortcuts\n",
    "that don't require you to compile a regex object first, but miss some\n",
    "fine-tuning parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third-party [regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/) module, which\n",
    "has an API compatible with the standard library `re` module, but offers\n",
    "additional functionality and a more thorough Unicode support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regular Expression Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it;\n",
    "the functions in this module let you check if a particular string\n",
    "matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression\n",
    "matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions;\n",
    "if *A* and *B* are both regular expressions, then *AB* is also a regular\n",
    "expression. In general, if a string *p* matches *A* and another string\n",
    "*q* matches *B*, the string *pq* will match AB. This holds unless *A* or\n",
    "*B* contain low precedence operations; boundary conditions between *A*\n",
    "and *B*; or have numbered group references. Thus, complex expressions\n",
    "can easily be constructed from simpler primitive expressions like the\n",
    "ones described here. For details of the theory and implementation of\n",
    "regular expressions, consult the Friedl book\n",
    "<a href=\"#Frie09\" class=\"citation\">[Frie09]</a>, or almost any textbook\n",
    "about compiler construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief explanation of the format of regular expressions follows. For\n",
    "further information and a gentler presentation, consult the\n",
    "`regex-howto`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters.\n",
    "Most ordinary characters, like `'A'`, `'a'`, or `'0'`, are the simplest\n",
    "regular expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate\n",
    "ordinary characters, so `last` matches the string `'last'`. (In the rest\n",
    "of this section, we'll write RE's in `this special style`, usually\n",
    "without quotes, and strings to be matched `'in single quotes'`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some characters, like `'|'` or `'('`, are special. Special characters\n",
    "either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the\n",
    "regular expressions around them are interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repetition operators or quantifiers (`*`, `+`, `?`, `{m,n}`, etc) cannot\n",
    "be directly nested. This avoids ambiguity with the non-greedy modifier\n",
    "suffix `?`, and with other modifiers in other implementations. To apply\n",
    "a second repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. For\n",
    "example, the expression `(?:a{6})*` matches any multiple of six `'a'`\n",
    "characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The special characters are:\n",

    "\n",
    "`.`  \n",
    "(Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline.\n",

    "matches both 'foo' and 'foobar', while the regular expression `foo$`\n",
    "matches only 'foo'. More interestingly, searching for `foo.$` in\n",
    "`'foo1\\nfoo2\\n'` matches 'foo2' normally, but 'foo1' in `MULTILINE`\n",
    "mode; searching for a single `$` in `'foo\\n'` will find two (empty)\n",
