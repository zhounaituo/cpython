    "\n",
    "The main direction for `asyncio` extending is writing custom *event\n",

    "`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop` declares very many methods. Implementing all\n",
    "them from scratch is a tedious job.\n",

    "A loop can get many common methods implementation for free by inheriting\n",
    "from `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`.\n",

    "In turn, the successor should implement a bunch of *private* methods\n",
    "declared but not implemented in `asyncio.BaseEventLoop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `loop.create_connection()` checks arguments, resolves DNS\n",
    "addresses, and calls `loop._make_socket_transport()` that should be\n",
    "implemented by inherited class. The `_make_socket_transport()` method is\n",
    "not documented and is considered as an *internal* API.\n",

    "## Future and Task private constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "`asyncio.Future` and `asyncio.Task` should be never created directly,\n",
    "please use corresponding `loop.create_future` and `loop.create_task`, or\n",
    "`asyncio.create_task` factories instead.\n",
    "\n",
