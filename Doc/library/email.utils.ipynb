    "**Source code:** `Lib/email/utils.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of useful utilities provided in the `email.utils`\n",
    "module:\n",
    "\n",
    "localtime(dt=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return local time as an aware datetime object. If called without\n",
    "arguments, return current time. Otherwise *dt* argument should be a\n",
    "`~datetime.datetime` instance, and it is converted to the local time\n",
    "zone according to the system time zone database. If *dt* is naive (that\n",
    "is, `dt.tzinfo` is `None`), it is assumed to be in local time. In this\n",
    "case, a positive or zero value for *isdst* causes `localtime` to presume\n",
    "initially that summer time (for example, Daylight Saving Time) is or is\n",
    "not (respectively) in effect for the specified time. A negative value\n",
    "for *isdst* causes the `localtime` to attempt to divine whether summer\n",
    "time is in effect for the specified time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "make_msgid(idstring=None, domain=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a string suitable for an `2822`-compliant `Message-ID` header.\n",
    "Optional *idstring* if given, is a string used to strengthen the\n",
    "uniqueness of the message id. Optional *domain* if given provides the\n",
    "portion of the msgid after the '@'. The default is the local hostname.\n",
    "It is not normally necessary to override this default, but may be useful\n",
    "certain cases, such as a constructing distributed system that uses a\n",
    "consistent domain name across multiple hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Added the *domain* keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining functions are part of the legacy (`Compat32`) email API.\n",
    "There is no need to directly use these with the new API, since the\n",
    "parsing and formatting they provide is done automatically by the header\n",
    "parsing machinery of the new API.\n",
    "\n",
    "quote(str)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a new string with backslashes in *str* replaced by two\n",
    "backslashes, and double quotes replaced by backslash-double quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "unquote(str)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a new string which is an *unquoted* version of *str*. If *str*\n",
    "ends and begins with double quotes, they are stripped off. Likewise if\n",
    "*str* ends and begins with angle brackets, they are stripped off.\n",
    "\n",
    "parseaddr(address)\n",
    "\n",
    "Parse address -- which should be the value of some address-containing\n",
    "field such as `To` or `Cc` -- into its constituent *realname* and *email\n",
    "address* parts. Returns a tuple of that information, unless the parse\n",
    "fails, in which case a 2-tuple of `('', '')` is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "formataddr(pair, charset='utf-8')\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of `parseaddr`, this takes a 2-tuple of the form\n",
    "`(realname, email_address)` and returns the string value suitable for a\n",
    "`To` or `Cc` header. If the first element of *pair* is false, then the\n",
    "second element is returned unmodified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional *charset* is the character set that will be used in the `2047`\n",
    "encoding of the `realname` if the `realname` contains non-ASCII\n",
    "characters. Can be an instance of `str` or a `~email.charset.Charset`.\n",
    "Defaults to `utf-8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Added the *charset* option.\n",
    "\n",
    "getaddresses(fieldvalues)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns a list of 2-tuples of the form returned by\n",
    "`parseaddr()`. *fieldvalues* is a sequence of header field values as\n",
    "might be returned by `Message.get_all <email.message.Message.get_all>`.\n",
    "Here's a simple example that gets all the recipients of a message:\n",

    "parsedate(date)\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempts to parse a date according to the rules in `2822`. however, some\n",
    "mailers don't follow that format as specified, so `parsedate` tries to\n",
    "guess correctly in such cases. *date* is a string containing an `2822`\n",
    "date, such as `\"Mon, 20 Nov 1995 19:12:08 -0500\"`. If it succeeds in\n",
    "parsing the date, `parsedate` returns a 9-tuple that can be passed\n",
    "directly to `time.mktime`; otherwise `None` will be returned. Note that\n",
    "indexes 6, 7, and 8 of the result tuple are not usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "parsedate_tz(date)\n",
    "\n",
    "Performs the same function as `parsedate`, but returns either `None` or\n",
    "a 10-tuple; the first 9 elements make up a tuple that can be passed\n",
    "directly to `time.mktime`, and the tenth is the offset of the date's\n",
    "timezone from UTC (which is the official term for Greenwich Mean\n",
    "Time)[1]. If the input string has no timezone, the last element of the\n",
    "tuple returned is `0`, which represents UTC. Note that indexes 6, 7, and\n",
    "8 of the result tuple are not usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "parsedate_to_datetime(date)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of `format_datetime`. Performs the same function as\n",
    "`parsedate`, but on success returns a `~datetime.datetime`; otherwise\n",
    "`ValueError` is raised if *date* contains an invalid value such as an\n",
    "hour greater than 23 or a timezone offset not between -24 and 24 hours.\n",
    "If the input date has a timezone of `-0000`, the `datetime` will be a\n",

    "timezone of the message the date comes from. If the input date has any\n",
    "other valid timezone offset, the `datetime` will be an aware `datetime`\n",
