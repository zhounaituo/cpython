    "\n",
    "## Simple Usage: Checking Examples in Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to start using doctest (but not necessarily the way\n",
    "you'll continue to do it) is to end each module `M` with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "        import doctest\n",
    "        doctest.testmod()\n",
    "\n",
    "`doctest` then examines docstrings in module `M`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the module as a script causes the examples in the docstrings to\n",
    "get executed and verified:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python M.py\n",
    "\n",
    "This won't display anything unless an example fails, in which case the\n",
    "failing example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to\n",
    "stdout, and the final line of output is `***Test Failed*** N failures.`,\n",
    "where *N* is the number of examples that failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run it with the `-v` switch instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python M.py -v\n",
    "\n",
    "and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to standard\n",
    "output, along with assorted summaries at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can force verbose mode by passing `verbose=True` to `testmod`, or\n",
    "prohibit it by passing `verbose=False`. In either of those cases,\n",
    "`sys.argv` is not examined by `testmod` (so passing `-v` or not has no\n",
    "effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a command line shortcut for running `testmod`. You can\n",
    "instruct the Python interpreter to run the doctest module directly from\n",
    "the standard library and pass the module name(s) on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python -m doctest -v example.py\n",
    "\n",
    "This will import `example.py` as a standalone module and run `testmod`\n",
    "on it. Note that this may not work correctly if the file is part of a\n",
    "package and imports other submodules from that package.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on `testmod`, see section `doctest-basic-api`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Usage: Checking Examples in a Text File\n",
    "\n",
    "Another simple application of doctest is testing interactive examples in\n",
    "a text file. This can be done with the `testfile` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import doctest\n",
    "    doctest.testfile(\"example.txt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "That short script executes and verifies any interactive Python examples\n",
    "contained in the file `example.txt`. The file content is treated as if\n",
    "it were a single giant docstring; the file doesn't need to contain a\n",
    "Python program! For example, perhaps `example.txt` contains this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` none\n",
    "The ``example`` module\n",
    "======================\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ``factorial``\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example text file in reStructuredText format.  First import\n",
    "``factorial`` from the ``example`` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> from example import factorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Now use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> factorial(6)\n",
    "    120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `doctest.testfile(\"example.txt\")` then finds the error in this\n",
    "documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    File \"./example.txt\", line 14, in example.txt\n",
    "    Failed example:\n",
    "        factorial(6)\n",
    "    Expected:\n",
    "        120\n",
    "    Got:\n",
    "        720\n",
    "\n",
    "As with `testmod`, `testfile` won't display anything unless an example\n",
    "fails. If an example does fail, then the failing example(s) and the\n",
    "cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout, using the same format\n",
    "as `testmod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `testfile` looks for files in the calling module's\n",
    "directory. See section `doctest-basic-api` for a description of the\n",
    "optional arguments that can be used to tell it to look for files in\n",
    "other locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `testmod`, `testfile`'s verbosity can be set with the `-v`\n",
    "command-line switch or with the optional keyword argument *verbose*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a command line shortcut for running `testfile`. You can\n",
    "instruct the Python interpreter to run the doctest module directly from\n",
    "the standard library and pass the file name(s) on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python -m doctest -v example.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the file name does not end with `.py`, `doctest` infers that it\n",
    "must be run with `testfile`, not `testmod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on `testfile`, see section `doctest-basic-api`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This section examines in detail how doctest works: which docstrings it\n",
    "looks at, how it finds interactive examples, what execution context it\n",
    "uses, how it handles exceptions, and how option flags can be used to\n",
    "control its behavior. This is the information that you need to know to\n",
    "write doctest examples; for information about actually running doctest\n",
    "on these examples, see the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Docstrings Are Examined?\n",
    "\n",
    "The module docstring, and all function, class and method docstrings are\n",
    "searched. Objects imported into the module are not searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if `M.__test__` exists and \"is true\", it must be a dict,\n",
    "and each entry maps a (string) name to a function object, class object,\n",
    "or string. Function and class object docstrings found from `M.__test__`\n",
    "are searched, and strings are treated as if they were docstrings. In\n",
    "output, a key `K` in `M.__test__` appears with name :\n",
    "\n",
    "    <name of M>.__test__.K\n",
    "\n",
    "Any classes found are recursively searched similarly, to test docstrings\n",
    "in their contained methods and nested classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are Docstring Examples Recognized?\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases a copy-and-paste of an interactive console session works\n",
    "fine, but doctest isn't trying to do an exact emulation of any specific\n",
    "Python shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> # comments are ignored\n",
    "    >>> x = 12\n",
    "    >>> x\n",
    "    12\n",
    "    >>> if x == 13:\n",
    "    ...     print(\"yes\")\n",
    "    ... else:\n",
    "    ...     print(\"no\")\n",
    "    ...     print(\"NO\")\n",
    "    ...     print(\"NO!!!\")\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    no\n",
    "    NO\n",
    "    NO!!!\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "\n",
    "single: \\>\\>\\>; interpreter prompt single: ...; interpreter prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Any expected output must immediately follow the final `'>>> '` or\n",
    "`'... '` line containing the code, and the expected output (if any)\n",
    "extends to the next `'>>> '` or all-whitespace line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine print:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Expected output cannot contain an all-whitespace line, since such a\n",
    "    line is taken to signal the end of expected output. If expected\n",
    "    output does contain a blank line, put `<BLANKLINE>` in your doctest\n",
    "    example each place a blank line is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   All hard tab characters are expanded to spaces, using 8-column tab\n",
    "    stops. Tabs in output generated by the tested code are not modified.\n",
    "    Because any hard tabs in the sample output *are* expanded, this\n",
    "    means that if the code output includes hard tabs, the only way the\n",
    "    doctest can pass is if the `NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE` option or\n",
    "    `directive <doctest-directives>` is in effect. Alternatively, the\n",
    "    test can be rewritten to capture the output and compare it to an\n",
    "    expected value as part of the test. This handling of tabs in the\n",
    "    source was arrived at through trial and error, and has proven to be\n",
    "    the least error prone way of handling them. It is possible to use a\n",
    "    different algorithm for handling tabs by writing a custom\n",
    "    `DocTestParser` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Output to stdout is captured, but not output to stderr (exception\n",
    "    tracebacks are captured via a different means).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If you continue a line via backslashing in an interactive session,\n",
    "    or for any other reason use a backslash, you should use a raw\n",
    "    docstring, which will preserve your backslashes exactly as you type\n",
    "    them:\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> def f(x):\n",
    "        ...     r'''Backslashes in a raw docstring: m\\n'''\n",
    "        >>> print(f.__doc__)\n",
    "        Backslashes in a raw docstring: m\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "    Otherwise, the backslash will be interpreted as part of the string.\n",
    "    For example, the `\\n` above would be interpreted as a newline\n",
    "    character. Alternatively, you can double each backslash in the\n",
    "    doctest version (and not use a raw string):\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> def f(x):\n",
    "        ...     '''Backslashes in a raw docstring: m\\\\n'''\n",
    "        >>> print(f.__doc__)\n",
    "        Backslashes in a raw docstring: m\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The starting column doesn't matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> assert \"Easy!\"\n",
    "              >>> import math\n",
    "                  >>> math.floor(1.9)\n",
    "                  1\n",
    "\n",
    "    and as many leading whitespace characters are stripped from the\n",
    "    expected output as appeared in the initial `'>>> '` line that\n",
    "    started the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the Execution Context?\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, each time `doctest` finds a docstring to test, it uses a\n",
    "*shallow copy* of `M`'s globals, so that running tests doesn't change\n",
    "the module's real globals, and so that one test in `M` can't leave\n",
    "behind crumbs that accidentally allow another test to work. This means\n",
    "examples can freely use any names defined at top-level in `M`, and names\n",
    "defined earlier in the docstring being run. Examples cannot see names\n",
    "defined in other docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can force use of your own dict as the execution context by passing\n",
    "`globs=your_dict` to `testmod` or `testfile` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What About Exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "No problem, provided that the traceback is the only output produced by\n",
    "the example: just paste in the traceback.[1] Since tracebacks contain\n",
    "details that are likely to change rapidly (for example, exact file paths\n",
    "and line numbers), this is one case where doctest works hard to be\n",
    "flexible in what it accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> [1, 2, 3].remove(42)\n",
    "    Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "    ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list\n",
    "\n",
    "That doctest succeeds if `ValueError` is raised, with the\n",
    "`list.remove(x): x not in list` detail as shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output for an exception must start with a traceback header,\n",
    "which may be either of the following two lines, indented the same as the\n",
    "first line of the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "    Traceback (innermost last):\n",
    "\n",
    "The traceback header is followed by an optional traceback stack, whose\n",
    "contents are ignored by doctest. The traceback stack is typically\n",
    "omitted, or copied verbatim from an interactive session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traceback stack is followed by the most interesting part: the\n",
    "line(s) containing the exception type and detail. This is usually the\n",
    "last line of a traceback, but can extend across multiple lines if the\n",
    "exception has a multi-line detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> raise ValueError('multi\\n    line\\ndetail')\n",
    "    Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "    ValueError: multi\n",
    "        line\n",
    "    detail\n",
    "\n",
    "The last three lines (starting with `ValueError`) are compared against\n",
    "the exception's type and detail, and the rest are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice is to omit the traceback stack, unless it adds significant\n",
    "documentation value to the example. So the last example is probably\n",
    "better as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> raise ValueError('multi\\n    line\\ndetail')\n",
    "    Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    ValueError: multi\n",
    "        line\n",
    "    detail\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that tracebacks are treated very specially. In particular, in the\n",
    "rewritten example, the use of `...` is independent of doctest's\n",
    "`ELLIPSIS` option. The ellipsis in that example could be left out, or\n",
    "could just as well be three (or three hundred) commas or digits, or an\n",

    "\n",
    "Some details you should read once, but won't need to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Doctest can't guess whether your expected output came from an\n",
    "    exception traceback or from ordinary printing. So, e.g., an example\n",
    "    that expects `ValueError: 42 is prime` will pass whether\n",
    "    `ValueError` is actually raised or if the example merely prints that\n",
    "    traceback text. In practice, ordinary output rarely begins with a\n",
    "    traceback header line, so this doesn't create real problems.\n",
    "-   Each line of the traceback stack (if present) must be indented\n",
    "    further than the first line of the example, *or* start with a\n",
    "    non-alphanumeric character. The first line following the traceback\n",
    "    header indented the same and starting with an alphanumeric is taken\n",

    "    right thing for genuine tracebacks.\n",
    "-   When the `IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL` doctest option is specified,\n",
    "    everything following the leftmost colon and any module information\n",
    "    in the exception name is ignored.\n",
    "-   The interactive shell omits the traceback header line for some\n",

    "As mentioned in the introduction, `doctest` has grown to have three\n",
    "primary uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Checking examples in docstrings.\n",
    "2.  Regression testing.\n",
    "3.  Executable documentation / literate testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These uses have different requirements, and it is important to\n",
    "distinguish them. In particular, filling your docstrings with obscure\n",
    "test cases makes for bad documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a docstring, choose docstring examples with care. There's\n",
    "an art to this that needs to be learned---it may not be natural at\n",
    "first. Examples should add genuine value to the documentation. A good\n",
    "example can often be worth many words. If done with care, the examples\n",
    "will be invaluable for your users, and will pay back the time it takes\n",
    "to collect them many times over as the years go by and things change.\n",
    "I'm still amazed at how often one of my `doctest` examples stops working\n",
    "after a \"harmless\" change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctest also makes an excellent tool for regression testing, especially\n",
    "if you don't skimp on explanatory text. By interleaving prose and\n",
    "examples, it becomes much easier to keep track of what's actually being\n",
    "tested, and why. When a test fails, good prose can make it much easier\n",
    "to figure out what the problem is, and how it should be fixed. It's true\n",
    "that you could write extensive comments in code-based testing, but few\n",
    "programmers do. Many have found that using doctest approaches instead\n",
    "leads to much clearer tests. Perhaps this is simply because doctest\n",
    "makes writing prose a little easier than writing code, while writing\n",
    "comments in code is a little harder. I think it goes deeper than just\n",
    "that: the natural attitude when writing a doctest-based test is that you\n",
    "want to explain the fine points of your software, and illustrate them\n",
    "with examples. This in turn naturally leads to test files that start\n",
    "with the simplest features, and logically progress to complications and\n",
    "edge cases. A coherent narrative is the result, instead of a collection\n",
    "of isolated functions that test isolated bits of functionality seemingly\n",
    "at random. It's a different attitude, and produces different results,\n",
    "blurring the distinction between testing and explaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression testing is best confined to dedicated objects or files. There\n",
    "are several options for organizing tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Write text files containing test cases as interactive examples, and\n",
    "    test the files using `testfile` or `DocFileSuite`. This is\n",
    "    recommended, although is easiest to do for new projects, designed\n",
    "    from the start to use doctest.\n",
    "-   Define functions named `_regrtest_topic` that consist of single\n",
    "    docstrings, containing test cases for the named topics. These\n",
