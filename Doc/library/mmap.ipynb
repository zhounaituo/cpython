    "# `mmap` --- Memory-mapped file support\n",
    "\n",
    "mmap\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory-mapped file objects behave like both `bytearray` and like\n",
    "`file objects <file object>`. You can use mmap objects in most places\n",
    "where `bytearray` are expected; for example, you can use the `re` module\n",
    "to search through a memory-mapped file. You can also change a single\n",
    "byte by doing `obj[index] = 97`, or change a subsequence by assigning to\n",
    "a slice: `obj[i1:i2] = b'...'`. You can also read and write data\n",
    "starting at the current file position, and `seek` through the file to\n",
    "different positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A memory-mapped file is created by the `~mmap.mmap` constructor, which\n",
    "is different on Unix and on Windows. In either case you must provide a\n",
    "file descriptor for a file opened for update. If you wish to map an\n",
    "existing Python file object, use its `fileno` method to obtain the\n",
    "correct value for the *fileno* parameter. Otherwise, you can open the\n",
    "file using the `os.open` function, which returns a file descriptor\n",
    "directly (the file still needs to be closed when done).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to create a memory-mapping for a writable, buffered file,\n",
    "you should `~io.IOBase.flush` the file first. This is necessary to\n",
    "ensure that local modifications to the buffers are actually available to\n",
    "the mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both the Unix and Windows versions of the constructor, *access* may\n",
    "be specified as an optional keyword parameter. *access* accepts one of\n",
    "four values: `ACCESS_READ`, `ACCESS_WRITE`, or `ACCESS_COPY` to specify\n",
    "read-only, write-through or copy-on-write memory respectively, or\n",
    "`ACCESS_DEFAULT` to defer to *prot*. *access* can be used on both Unix\n",
    "and Windows. If *access* is not specified, Windows mmap returns a\n",
    "write-through mapping. The initial memory values for all three access\n",
    "types are taken from the specified file. Assignment to an `ACCESS_READ`\n",
    "memory map raises a `TypeError` exception. Assignment to an\n",
    "`ACCESS_WRITE` memory map affects both memory and the underlying file.\n",
    "Assignment to an `ACCESS_COPY` memory map affects memory but does not\n",
    "update the underlying file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 Added `ACCESS_DEFAULT` constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "To map anonymous memory, -1 should be passed as the fileno along with\n",
    "the length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Windows version)** Maps *length* bytes from the file specified by the\n",
    "file handle *fileno*, and creates a mmap object. If *length* is larger\n",
    "than the current size of the file, the file is extended to contain\n",
    "*length* bytes. If *length* is `0`, the maximum length of the map is the\n",
    "current size of the file, except that if the file is empty Windows\n",
    "raises an exception (you cannot create an empty mapping on Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "*tagname*, if specified and not `None`, is a string giving a tag name\n",
    "for the mapping. Windows allows you to have many different mappings\n",
    "against the same file. If you specify the name of an existing tag, that\n",
    "tag is opened, otherwise a new tag of this name is created. If this\n",
    "parameter is omitted or `None`, the mapping is created without a name.\n",
    "Avoiding the use of the tag parameter will assist in keeping your code\n",
    "portable between Unix and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "*offset* may be specified as a non-negative integer offset. mmap\n",
    "references will be relative to the offset from the beginning of the\n",
    "file. *offset* defaults to 0. *offset* must be a multiple of the\n",

    "the maximum length of the map will be the current size of the file when\n",
    "`~mmap.mmap` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "*flags* specifies the nature of the mapping. `MAP_PRIVATE` creates a\n",
    "private copy-on-write mapping, so changes to the contents of the mmap\n",
    "object will be private to this process, and `MAP_SHARED` creates a\n",
    "mapping that's shared with all other processes mapping the same areas of\n",
    "the file. The default value is `MAP_SHARED`. Some systems have\n",
    "additional possible flags with the full list specified in\n",
    "`MAP_* constants <map-constants>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*prot*, if specified, gives the desired memory protection; the two most\n",
    "useful values are `PROT_READ` and `PROT_WRITE`, to specify that the\n",
    "pages may be read or written. *prot* defaults to\n",
    "`PROT_READ \\| PROT_WRITE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*access* may be specified in lieu of *flags* and *prot* as an optional\n",
    "keyword parameter. It is an error to specify both *flags*, *prot* and\n",
    "*access*. See the description of *access* above for information on how\n",
    "to use this parameter.\n",

    "*offset* may be specified as a non-negative integer offset. mmap\n",
    "references will be relative to the offset from the beginning of the\n",
