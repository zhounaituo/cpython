    "An `abstract base class` to provide the ability to read *resources*.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of this ABC, a *resource* is a binary artifact that\n",
    "is shipped within a package. Typically this is something like a data\n",
    "file that lives next to the `__init__.py` file of the package. The\n",
    "purpose of this class is to help abstract out the accessing of such data\n",
    "files so that it does not matter if the package and its data file(s) are\n",
    "stored in a e.g. zip file versus on the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any of methods of this class, a *resource* argument is expected to\n",
    "be a `path-like object` which represents conceptually just a file name.\n",
    "This means that no subdirectory paths should be included in the\n",
    "*resource* argument. This is because the location of the package the\n",
    "reader is for, acts as the \"directory\". Hence the metaphor for\n",
    "directories and file names is packages and resources, respectively. This\n",
    "is also why instances of this class are expected to directly correlate\n",
    "to a specific package (instead of potentially representing multiple\n",
    "packages or a module).\n",
