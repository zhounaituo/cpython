    "stack traces of Python programs. It exactly mimics the behavior of the\n",
    "Python interpreter when it prints a stack trace. This is useful when you\n",

    "all entries are printed. If *file* is omitted or `None`, the output goes\n",
    "to `sys.stderr`; otherwise it should be an open file or file-like object\n",
    "to receive the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.5 Added negative *limit* support.\n",
