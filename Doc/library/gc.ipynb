    "This module provides an interface to the optional garbage collector. It\n",
    "provides the ability to disable the collector, tune the collection\n",
    "frequency, and set debugging options. It also provides access to\n",
    "unreachable objects that the collector found but cannot free. Since the\n",
    "collector supplements the reference counting already used in Python, you\n",
    "can disable the collector if you are sure your program does not create\n",
    "reference cycles. Automatic collection can be disabled by calling\n",
    "`gc.disable()`. To debug a leaking program call\n",
