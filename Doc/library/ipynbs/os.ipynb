    "This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent\n",

    "Notes on the availability of these functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The design of all built-in operating system dependent modules of\n",
    "    Python is such that as long as the same functionality is available,\n",
    "    it uses the same interface; for example, the function\n",
    "    `os.stat(path)` returns stat information about *path* in the same\n",
    "    format (which happens to have originated with the POSIX interface).\n",
    "-   Extensions peculiar to a particular operating system are also\n",
    "    available through the `os` module, but using them is of course a\n",
    "    threat to portability.\n",
    "-   All functions accepting path or file names accept both bytes and\n",
    "    string objects, and result in an object of the same type, if a path\n",
    "    or file name is returned.\n",
    "-   On VxWorks, os.popen, os.fork, os.execv and os.spawn\\*p\\* are not\n",
    "    supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions in this module raise `OSError` (or subclasses thereof) in\n",
    "the case of invalid or inaccessible file names and paths, or other\n",
    "arguments that have the correct type, but are not accepted by the\n",
    "operating system.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, file names, command line arguments, and environment variables\n",
    "are represented using the string type. On some systems, decoding these\n",
    "strings to and from bytes is necessary before passing them to the\n",
