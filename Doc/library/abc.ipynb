    "This module provides the infrastructure for defining `abstract base\n",
    "classes <abstract base class>` (ABCs) in Python, as outlined in `3119`;\n",
    "see the PEP for why this was added to Python. (See also `3141` and the\n",
    "`numbers` module regarding a type hierarchy for numbers based on ABCs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` module has some concrete classes that derive from\n",
    "ABCs; these can, of course, be further derived. In addition, the\n",
    "`collections.abc` submodule has some ABCs that can be used to test\n",
    "whether a class or instance provides a particular interface, for\n",
    "example, if it is hashable or if it is a mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module provides the metaclass `ABCMeta` for defining ABCs and a\n",
    "helper class `ABC` to alternatively define ABCs through inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "A helper class that has `ABCMeta` as its metaclass. With this class, an\n",
    "abstract base class can be created by simply deriving from `ABC`\n",
    "avoiding sometimes confusing metaclass usage, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from abc import ABC\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyABC(ABC):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the type of `ABC` is still `ABCMeta`, therefore inheriting\n",
    "from `ABC` requires the usual precautions regarding metaclass usage, as\n",
    "multiple inheritance may lead to metaclass conflicts. One may also\n",
    "define an abstract base class by passing the metaclass keyword and using\n",
    "`ABCMeta` directly, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from abc import ABCMeta\n",

    "Metaclass for defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this metaclass to create an ABC. An ABC can be subclassed directly,\n",
    "and then acts as a mix-in class. You can also register unrelated\n",
    "concrete classes (even built-in classes) and unrelated ABCs as \"virtual\n",
    "subclasses\" --these and their descendants will be considered subclasses\n",
    "of the registering ABC by the built-in `issubclass` function, but the\n",

    "3.4 To detect calls to `register`, you can use the `get_cache_token`\n",
    "function.\n",

    "\\_\\_subclasshook\\_\\_(subclass)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Must be defined as a class method.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Check whether *subclass* is considered a subclass of this ABC. This\n",
    "means that you can customize the behavior of `issubclass` further\n",
    "without the need to call `register` on every class you want to consider\n",
    "a subclass of the ABC. (This class method is called from the\n",
    "`__subclasscheck__` method of the ABC.)\n",

    "The `abc` module also provides the following decorator:\n",
    "\n",

    "A decorator indicating abstract methods.\n",

    "cannot be instantiated unless all of its abstract methods and properties\n",
    "are overridden. The abstract methods can be called using any of the\n",
    "normal 'super' call mechanisms. `abstractmethod` may be used to declare\n",

    "method are not affected.\n",
