    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This module exists for backwards compatibility only. For new code we\n",
    "recommend using `asyncio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module builds on the `asyncore` infrastructure, simplifying\n",
    "asynchronous clients and servers and making it easier to handle\n",
    "protocols whose elements are terminated by arbitrary strings, or are of\n",
    "variable length. `asynchat` defines the abstract class `async_chat` that\n",
    "you subclass, providing implementations of the `collect_incoming_data`\n",
    "and `found_terminator` methods. It uses the same asynchronous loop as\n",
    "`asyncore`, and the two types of channel, `asyncore.dispatcher` and\n",
    "`asynchat.async_chat`, can freely be mixed in the channel map. Typically\n",
    "an `asyncore.dispatcher` server channel generates new\n",
    "`asynchat.async_chat` channel objects as it receives incoming connection\n",
    "requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is an abstract subclass of `asyncore.dispatcher`. To make\n",
    "practical use of the code you must subclass `async_chat`, providing\n",
    "meaningful `collect_incoming_data` and `found_terminator` methods. The\n",
    "`asyncore.dispatcher` methods can be used, although not all make sense\n",
    "in a message/response context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `asyncore.dispatcher`, `async_chat` defines a set of events that\n",
    "are generated by an analysis of socket conditions after a :c`select`\n",
    "call. Once the polling loop has been started the `async_chat` object's\n",
    "methods are called by the event-processing framework with no action on\n",
    "the part of the programmer.\n",

    "The asynchronous output buffer size (default `4096`).\n",

    "Unlike `asyncore.dispatcher`, `async_chat` allows you to define a\n",
    "`FIFO (first-in, first-out)` queue of *producers*. A producer need have\n",
    "only one method, `more`, which should return data to be transmitted on\n",
    "the channel. The producer indicates exhaustion (*i.e.* that it contains\n",
    "no more data) by having its `more` method return the empty bytes object.\n",
    "At this point the `async_chat` object removes the producer from the\n",
    "queue and starts using the next producer, if any. When the producer\n",
    "queue is empty the `handle_write` method does nothing. You use the\n",
    "channel object's `set_terminator` method to describe how to recognize\n",
