    "This makes the locale somewhat painful to use correctly.\n",

    "matter what the user's preferred locale is. There is one exception: the\n",
    "`LC_CTYPE` category is changed at startup to set the current locale\n",
    "encoding to the user's preferred locale encoding. The program must\n",
    "explicitly say that it wants the user's preferred locale settings for\n",
    "other categories by calling `setlocale(LC_ALL, '')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally a bad idea to call `setlocale` in some library routine,\n",
    "since as a side effect it affects the entire program. Saving and\n",

    "If, when coding a module for general use, you need a locale independent\n",
    "version of an operation that is affected by the locale (such as certain\n",
    "formats used with `time.strftime`), you will have to find a way to do it\n",
    "without using the standard library routine. Even better is convincing\n",

    "strings, the conversions and classifications are done according to the\n",
