    "\n",
    "The `queue` module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues. It\n",
    "is especially useful in threaded programming when information must be\n",
    "exchanged safely between multiple threads. The `Queue` class in this\n",
    "module implements all the required locking semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module implements three types of queue, which differ only in the\n",
    "order in which the entries are retrieved. In a\n",
    "`FIFO (first-in, first-out)` queue, the first tasks added are the first\n",
    "retrieved. In a `LIFO (last-in, first-out)` queue, the most recently\n",
    "added entry is the first retrieved (operating like a stack). With a\n",
    "priority queue, the entries are kept sorted (using the `heapq` module)\n",
    "and the lowest valued entry is retrieved first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, those three types of queues use locks to temporarily block\n",
    "competing threads; however, they are not designed to handle reentrancy\n",
    "within a thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the module implements a \"simple\"\n",
    "`FIFO (first-in, first-out)` queue type, `SimpleQueue`, whose specific\n",
    "implementation provides additional guarantees in exchange for the\n",
    "smaller functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `queue` module defines the following classes and exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor for a `FIFO (first-in, first-out)` queue. *maxsize* is an\n",
    "integer that sets the upperbound limit on the number of items that can\n",
    "be placed in the queue. Insertion will block once this size has been\n",
    "reached, until queue items are consumed. If *maxsize* is less than or\n",
    "equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.\n",
    "\n",

    "The lowest valued entries are retrieved first (the lowest valued entry\n",

    "for entries is a tuple in the form: `(priority_number, data)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the *data* elements are not comparable, the data can be wrapped in a\n",
