    "When identifying things (such as host names) in the internet, it is\n",
    "often necessary to compare such identifications for \"equality\". Exactly\n",
    "how this comparison is executed may depend on the application domain,\n",
    "e.g. whether it should be case-insensitive or not. It may be also\n",
    "necessary to restrict the possible identifications, to allow only\n",
    "identifications consisting of \"printable\" characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`3454` defines a procedure for \"preparing\" Unicode strings in internet\n",
    "protocols. Before passing strings onto the wire, they are processed with\n",
    "the preparation procedure, after which they have a certain normalized\n",
    "form. The RFC defines a set of tables, which can be combined into\n",
    "profiles. Each profile must define which tables it uses, and what other\n",
    "optional parts of the `stringprep` procedure are part of the profile.\n",
    "One example of a `stringprep` profile is `nameprep`, which is used for\n",
    "internationalized domain names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `stringprep` only exposes the tables from `3454`. As these\n",
    "tables would be very large to represent them as dictionaries or lists,\n",
    "the module uses the Unicode character database internally. The module\n",
    "source code itself was generated using the `mkstringprep.py` utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, these tables are exposed as functions, not as data\n",
    "structures. There are two kinds of tables in the RFC: sets and mappings.\n",
    "For a set, `stringprep` provides the \"characteristic function\", i.e. a\n",
    "function that returns `True` if the parameter is part of the set. For\n",
    "mappings, it provides the mapping function: given the key, it returns\n",
    "the associated value. Below is a list of all functions available in the\n",
