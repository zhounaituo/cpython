    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This module defines three classes, `IMAP4`, `IMAP4_SSL` and\n",
    "`IMAP4_stream`, which encapsulate a connection to an IMAP4 server and\n",
    "implement a large subset of the IMAP4rev1 client protocol as defined in\n",
    "`2060`. It is backward compatible with IMAP4 (`1730`) servers, but note\n",
    "that the `STATUS` command is not supported in IMAP4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three classes are provided by the `imaplib` module, `IMAP4` is the base\n",
    "class:\n",
    "\n",
    "This class implements the actual IMAP4 protocol. The connection is\n",
    "created and protocol version (IMAP4 or IMAP4rev1) is determined when the\n",
    "instance is initialized. If *host* is not specified, `''` (the local\n",
    "host) is used. If *port* is omitted, the standard IMAP4 port (143) is\n",
    "used. The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds\n",
    "for the connection attempt. If timeout is not given or is None, the\n",
    "global default socket timeout is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IMAP4` class supports the `with` statement. When used like this,\n",
    "the IMAP4 `LOGOUT` command is issued automatically when the `!with`\n",
    "statement exits. E.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> from imaplib import IMAP4\n",
    "    >>> with IMAP4(\"domain.org\") as M:\n",
    "    ...     M.noop()\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    ('OK', [b'Nothing Accomplished. d25if65hy903weo.87'])\n",
    "\n",
    "3.5 Support for the `with` statement was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.9 The optional *timeout* parameter was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three exceptions are defined as attributes of the `IMAP4` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "IMAP4.error\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception raised on any errors. The reason for the exception is passed\n",
    "to the constructor as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMAP4.abort\n",
    "\n",
    "IMAP4 server errors cause this exception to be raised. This is a\n",
    "sub-class of `IMAP4.error`. Note that closing the instance and\n",
    "instantiating a new one will usually allow recovery from this exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMAP4.readonly\n",
    "\n",
    "This exception is raised when a writable mailbox has its status changed\n",
    "by the server. This is a sub-class of `IMAP4.error`. Some other client\n",
    "now has write permission, and the mailbox will need to be re-opened to\n",
    "re-obtain write permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also a subclass for secure connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a subclass derived from `IMAP4` that connects over an SSL\n",
    "encrypted socket (to use this class you need a socket module that was\n",
    "compiled with SSL support). If *host* is not specified, `''` (the local\n",
    "host) is used. If *port* is omitted, the standard IMAP4-over-SSL port\n",
    "(993) is used. *ssl_context* is a `ssl.SSLContext` object which allows\n",
    "bundling SSL configuration options, certificates and private keys into a\n",
    "single (potentially long-lived) structure. Please read `ssl-security`\n",
    "for best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "*keyfile* and *certfile* are a legacy alternative to *ssl_context* -\n",
    "they can point to PEM-formatted private key and certificate chain files\n",
    "for the SSL connection. Note that the *keyfile*/*certfile* parameters\n",
    "are mutually exclusive with *ssl_context*, a `ValueError` is raised if\n",
    "*keyfile*/*certfile* is provided along with *ssl_context*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the\n",
    "connection attempt. If timeout is not given or is None, the global\n",
    "default socket timeout is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 *ssl_context* parameter was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 The class now supports hostname check with\n",
    "`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and *Server Name Indication* (see\n",
    "`ssl.HAS_SNI`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6\n",
    "\n",
    "*keyfile* and *certfile* are deprecated in favor of *ssl_context*.\n",
    "Please use `ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain` instead, or let\n",
    "`ssl.create_default_context` select the system's trusted CA certificates\n",
    "for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.9 The optional *timeout* parameter was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second subclass allows for connections created by a child process:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a subclass derived from `IMAP4` that connects to the\n",
    "`stdin/stdout` file descriptors created by passing *command* to\n",
    "`subprocess.Popen()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following utility functions are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "Internaldate2tuple(datestr)\n",
    "\n",
    "Parse an IMAP4 `INTERNALDATE` string and return corresponding local\n",
    "time. The return value is a `time.struct_time` tuple or `None` if the\n",
    "string has wrong format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Int2AP(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts an integer into a bytes representation using characters from\n",
    "the set \\[`A` .. `P`\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "ParseFlags(flagstr)\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts an IMAP4 `FLAGS` response to a tuple of individual flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time2Internaldate(date_time)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert *date_time* to an IMAP4 `INTERNALDATE` representation. The\n",
    "return value is a string in the form: `\"DD-Mmm-YYYY HH:MM:SS +HHMM\"`\n",
    "(including double-quotes). The *date_time* argument can be a number (int\n",
    "or float) representing seconds since epoch (as returned by `time.time`),\n",
    "a 9-tuple representing local time an instance of `time.struct_time` (as\n",
    "returned by `time.localtime`), an aware instance of `datetime.datetime`,\n",
    "or a double-quoted string. In the last case, it is assumed to already be\n",
    "in the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that IMAP4 message numbers change as the mailbox changes; in\n",
    "particular, after an `EXPUNGE` command performs deletions the remaining\n",
    "messages are renumbered. So it is highly advisable to use UIDs instead,\n",
    "with the UID command.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the module, there is a test section that contains a more\n",

    "or double quotes) each string is quoted. However, the *password*\n",

    "then enclose the string in parentheses (eg: `r'(\\Deleted)'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each command returns a tuple: `(type, [data, ...])` where *type* is\n",
    "usually `'OK'` or `'NO'`, and *data* is either the text from the command\n",
    "response, or mandated results from the command. Each *data* is either a\n",
