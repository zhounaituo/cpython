    "The `py_compile` module provides a function to generate a byte-code file\n",
    "from a source file, and another function used when the module source\n",
    "file is invoked as a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though not often needed, this function can be useful when installing\n",
    "modules for shared use, especially if some of the users may not have\n",
    "permission to write the byte-code cache files in the directory\n",
    "containing the source code.\n",

    "Compile a source file to byte-code and write out the byte-code cache\n",
    "file. The source code is loaded from the file named *file*. The\n",
    "byte-code is written to *cfile*, which defaults to the `3147`/`488`\n",
    "path, ending in `.pyc`. For example, if *file* is `/foo/bar/baz.py`\n",
    "*cfile* will default to `/foo/bar/__pycache__/baz.cpython-32.pyc` for\n",
    "Python 3.2. If *dfile* is specified, it is used as the name of the\n",
    "source file in error messages instead of *file*. If *doraise* is true, a\n",
    "`PyCompileError` is raised when an error is encountered while compiling\n",
    "*file*. If *doraise* is false (the default), an error string is written\n",
    "to `sys.stderr`, but no exception is raised. This function returns the\n",
    "path to byte-compiled file, i.e. whatever *cfile* value was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *doraise* and *quiet* arguments determine how errors are handled\n",
    "while compiling file. If *quiet* is 0 or 1, and *doraise* is false, the\n",
    "default behaviour is enabled: an error string is written to\n",
    "`sys.stderr`, and the function returns `None` instead of a path. If\n",
    "*doraise* is true, a `PyCompileError` is raised instead. However if\n",
    "*quiet* is 2, no message is written, and *doraise* has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the path that *cfile* becomes (either explicitly specified or\n",
    "computed) is a symlink or non-regular file, `FileExistsError` will be\n",
    "raised. This is to act as a warning that import will turn those paths\n",
    "into regular files if it is allowed to write byte-compiled files to\n",
    "those paths. This is a side-effect of import using file renaming to\n",
    "place the final byte-compiled file into place to prevent concurrent file\n",
    "writing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "*optimize* controls the optimization level and is passed to the built-in\n",
    "`compile` function. The default of `-1` selects the optimization level\n",
    "of the current interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*invalidation_mode* should be a member of the `PycInvalidationMode` enum\n",
    "and controls how the generated bytecode cache is invalidated at runtime.\n",
    "The default is `PycInvalidationMode.CHECKED_HASH` if the\n",

    "Previous default was *file* + `'c'` (`'o'` if optimization was enabled).\n",
    "Also added the *optimize* parameter.\n",

    "writing. This means file creation/writing semantics now match what\n",
