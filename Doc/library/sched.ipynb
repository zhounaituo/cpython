    "*timefunc* should be callable without arguments, and return a number\n",
    "(the \"time\", in any units whatsoever). The *delayfunc* function should\n",
    "be callable with one argument, compatible with the output of *timefunc*,\n",
    "and should delay that many time units. *delayfunc* will also be called\n",
