    "asyncio queues are designed to be similar to classes of the `queue`\n",
    "module. Although asyncio queues are not thread-safe, they are designed\n",
    "to be used specifically in async/await code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that methods of asyncio queues don't have a *timeout* parameter;\n",
    "use `asyncio.wait_for` function to do queue operations with a timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also the [Examples](#examples) section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A first in, first out (FIFO) queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *maxsize* is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.\n",
    "If it is an integer greater than `0`, then `await put()` blocks when the\n",
    "queue reaches *maxsize* until an item is removed by `get`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the standard library threading `queue`, the size of the queue is\n",
    "always known and can be returned by calling the `qsize` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 Removed the *loop* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is `not thread safe <asyncio-multithreading>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "maxsize\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of items allowed in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "empty()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "full()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `True` if there are `maxsize` items in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the queue was initialized with `maxsize=0` (the default), then\n",
    "`full()` never returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",

    "an item is available.\n",

    "join()\n",
    "\n",
    "Block until all items in the queue have been received and processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The count of unfinished tasks goes up whenever an item is added to the\n",
    "queue. The count goes down whenever a consumer coroutine calls\n",
    "`task_done` to indicate that the item was retrieved and all work on it\n",
    "is complete. When the count of unfinished tasks drops to zero, `join`\n",
    "unblocks.\n",

    "Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used by queue consumers. For each `~Queue.get` used to fetch a task, a\n",
    "subsequent call to `task_done` tells the queue that the processing on\n",
    "the task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a `join` is currently blocking, it will resume when all items have\n",
    "been processed (meaning that a `task_done` call was received for every\n",
    "item that had been `~Queue.put` into the queue).\n",

    "## Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A variant of `Queue`; retrieves entries in priority order (lowest\n",

    "Entries are typically tuples of the form `(priority_number, data)`.\n",
