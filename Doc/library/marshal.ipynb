    "This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in\n",
    "a binary format. The format is specific to Python, but independent of\n",
    "machine architecture issues (e.g., you can write a Python value to a\n",
    "file on a PC, transport the file to a Sun, and read it back there).\n",
    "Details of the format are undocumented on purpose; it may change between\n",
    "Python versions (although it rarely does).[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "module: pickle module: shelve\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a general \"persistence\" module. For general persistence and\n",
    "transfer of Python objects through RPC calls, see the modules `pickle`\n",
    "and `shelve`. The `marshal` module exists mainly to support reading and\n",
    "writing the \"pseudo-compiled\" code for Python modules of `.pyc` files.\n",
    "Therefore, the Python maintainers reserve the right to modify the\n",
    "marshal format in backward incompatible ways should the need arise. If\n",
    "you're serializing and de-serializing Python objects, use the `pickle`\n",
