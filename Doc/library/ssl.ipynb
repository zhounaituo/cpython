    "This module provides access to Transport Layer Security (often known as\n",

    "for network sockets, both client-side and server-side. This module uses\n",
    "the OpenSSL library. It is available on all modern Unix systems,\n",
    "Windows, macOS, and probably additional platforms, as long as OpenSSL is\n",
    "installed on that platform.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Some behavior may be platform dependent, since calls are made to the\n",

    "\n",
    "Certificates in general are part of a public-key / private-key system.\n",
    "In this system, each *principal*, (which may be a machine, or a person,\n",
    "or an organization) is assigned a unique two-part encryption key. One\n",
    "part of the key is public, and is called the *public key*; the other\n",
    "part is kept secret, and is called the *private key*. The two parts are\n",
    "related, in that if you encrypt a message with one of the parts, you can\n",
    "decrypt it with the other part, and **only** with the other part.\n",
    "\n",
    "A certificate contains information about two principals. It contains the\n",
    "name of a *subject*, and the subject's public key. It also contains a\n",
    "statement by a second principal, the *issuer*, that the subject is who\n",
    "they claim to be, and that this is indeed the subject's public key. The\n",
    "issuer's statement is signed with the issuer's private key, which only\n",
    "the issuer knows. However, anyone can verify the issuer's statement by\n",
    "finding the issuer's public key, decrypting the statement with it, and\n",
    "comparing it to the other information in the certificate. The\n",
    "certificate also contains information about the time period over which\n",
    "it is valid. This is expressed as two fields, called \"notBefore\" and\n",
    "\"notAfter\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python use of certificates, a client or server can use a\n",
    "certificate to prove who they are. The other side of a network\n",
    "connection can also be required to produce a certificate, and that\n",
    "certificate can be validated to the satisfaction of the client or server\n",
    "that requires such validation. The connection attempt can be set to\n",
    "raise an exception if the validation fails. Validation is done\n",
    "automatically, by the underlying OpenSSL framework; the application need\n",
    "not concern itself with its mechanics. But the application does usually\n",
    "need to provide sets of certificates to allow this process to take\n",
    "place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses files to contain certificates. They should be formatted as\n",
    "\"PEM\" (see `1422`), which is a base-64 encoded form wrapped with a\n",
    "header line and a footer line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "    ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...\n",
    "    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Certificate chains\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python files which contain certificates can contain a sequence of\n",
    "certificates, sometimes called a *certificate chain*. This chain should\n",
    "start with the specific certificate for the principal who \"is\" the\n",
    "client or server, and then the certificate for the issuer of that\n",
    "certificate, and then the certificate for the issuer of *that*\n",
    "certificate, and so on up the chain till you get to a certificate which\n",
    "is *self-signed*, that is, a certificate which has the same subject and\n",
    "issuer, sometimes called a *root certificate*. The certificates should\n",
    "just be concatenated together in the certificate file. For example,\n",
    "suppose we had a three certificate chain, from our server certificate to\n",
    "the certificate of the certification authority that signed our server\n",
    "certificate, to the root certificate of the agency which issued the\n",
    "certification authority's certificate:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "    ... (certificate for your server)...\n",
    "    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "    ... (the certificate for the CA)...\n",
    "    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "    ... (the root certificate for the CA's issuer)...\n",
    "    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### CA certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going to require validation of the other side of the\n",
    "connection's certificate, you need to provide a \"CA certs\" file, filled\n",
    "with the certificate chains for each issuer you are willing to trust.\n",
    "Again, this file just contains these chains concatenated together. For\n",
    "validation, Python will use the first chain it finds in the file which\n",
    "matches. The platform's certificates file can be used by calling\n",
    "`SSLContext.load_default_certs`, this is done automatically with\n",
    "`.create_default_context`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combined key and certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the private key is stored in the same file as the certificate; in\n",
    "this case, only the `certfile` parameter to `SSLContext.load_cert_chain`\n",
    "and `wrap_socket` needs to be passed. If the private key is stored with\n",
    "the certificate, it should come before the first certificate in the\n",
    "certificate chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "    ... (private key in base64 encoding) ...\n",
    "    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "    ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...\n",
    "    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-signed certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going to create a server that provides SSL-encrypted\n",
    "connection services, you will need to acquire a certificate for that\n",
    "service. There are many ways of acquiring appropriate certificates, such\n",
    "as buying one from a certification authority. Another common practice is\n",
    "to generate a self-signed certificate. The simplest way to do this is\n",
    "with the OpenSSL package, using something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    % openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout cert.pem\n",
    "    Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key\n",
    "    .......++++++\n",
    "    .............................++++++\n",
    "    writing new private key to 'cert.pem'\n",
    "    -----\n",
    "    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated\n",
    "    into your certificate request.\n",
    "    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.\n",
    "    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank\n",
    "    For some fields there will be a default value,\n",
    "    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.\n",
    "    -----\n",
    "    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US\n",
    "    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:MyState\n",
    "    Locality Name (eg, city) []:Some City\n",

    "    %\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of a self-signed certificate is that it is its own root\n",
    "certificate, and no one else will have it in their cache of known (and\n",
    "trusted) root certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing for SSL support\n",
    "\n",
    "To test for the presence of SSL support in a Python installation, user\n",

    "SSL sockets behave slightly different than regular sockets in\n",
    "non-blocking mode. When working with non-blocking sockets, there are\n",
    "thus several things you need to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Most `SSLSocket` methods will raise either `SSLWantWriteError` or\n",
    "    `SSLWantReadError` instead of `BlockingIOError` if an I/O operation\n",
    "    would block. `SSLWantReadError` will be raised if a read operation\n",
    "    on the underlying socket is necessary, and `SSLWantWriteError` for a\n",
    "    write operation on the underlying socket. Note that attempts to\n",
    "    *write* to an SSL socket may require *reading* from the underlying\n",
    "    socket first, and attempts to *read* from the SSL socket may require\n",
    "    a prior *write* to the underlying socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.5\n",
    "\n",
    "    In earlier Python versions, the `!SSLSocket.send` method returned\n",
    "    zero instead of raising `SSLWantWriteError` or `SSLWantReadError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Calling `~select.select` tells you that the OS-level socket can be\n",
    "    read from (or written to), but it does not imply that there is\n",
    "    sufficient data at the upper SSL layer. For example, only part of an\n",
    "    SSL frame might have arrived. Therefore, you must be ready to handle\n",
    "    `SSLSocket.recv` and `SSLSocket.send` failures, and retry after\n",
    "    another call to `~select.select`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Conversely, since the SSL layer has its own framing, a SSL socket\n",
    "    may still have data available for reading without `~select.select`\n",
    "    being aware of it. Therefore, you should first call `SSLSocket.recv`\n",
    "    to drain any potentially available data, and then only block on a\n",
    "    `~select.select` call if still necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (of course, similar provisions apply when using other primitives\n",
    "    such as `~select.poll`, or those in the `selectors` module)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The SSL handshake itself will be non-blocking: the\n",

    "    successfully. Here is a synopsis using `~select.select` to wait for\n",

    "## Memory BIO Support\n",
    "\n",
    "3.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever since the SSL module was introduced in Python 2.6, the `SSLSocket`\n",
    "class has provided two related but distinct areas of functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   SSL protocol handling\n",
    "-   Network IO\n",
    "\n",
    "The network IO API is identical to that provided by `socket.socket`,\n",
    "from which `SSLSocket` also inherits. This allows an SSL socket to be\n",
    "used as a drop-in replacement for a regular socket, making it very easy\n",
    "to add SSL support to an existing application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining SSL protocol handling and network IO usually works well, but\n",
    "there are some cases where it doesn't. An example is async IO frameworks\n",
    "that want to use a different IO multiplexing model than the \"select/poll\n",
    "on a file descriptor\" (readiness based) model that is assumed by\n",
    "`socket.socket` and by the internal OpenSSL socket IO routines. This is\n",
    "mostly relevant for platforms like Windows where this model is not\n",
    "efficient. For this purpose, a reduced scope variant of `SSLSocket`\n",
    "called `SSLObject` is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reduced-scope variant of `SSLSocket` representing an SSL protocol\n",

    "\n",
    "This class has no public constructor. An `SSLObject` instance must be\n",
    "created using the `~SSLContext.wrap_bio` method. This method will create\n",
    "the `SSLObject` instance and bind it to a pair of BIOs. The *incoming*\n",
    "BIO is used to pass data from Python to the SSL protocol instance, while\n",
    "the *outgoing* BIO is used to pass data the other way around.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Best defaults\n",

    "security policy, it is highly recommended that you use the\n",
    "`create_default_context` function to create your SSL context. It will\n",
    "load the system's trusted CA certificates, enable certificate validation\n",
    "and hostname checking, and try to choose reasonably secure protocol and\n",
    "cipher settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is how you would use the `smtplib.SMTP` class to\n",
    "create a trusted, secure connection to a SMTP server:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import ssl, smtplib\n",
    "    >>> smtp = smtplib.SMTP(\"mail.python.org\", port=587)\n",

    "\n",
    "If a client certificate is needed for the connection, it can be added\n",
    "with `SSLContext.load_cert_chain`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, if you create the SSL context by calling the `SSLContext`\n",
    "constructor yourself, it will not have certificate validation nor\n",
    "hostname checking enabled by default. If you do so, please read the\n",
    "paragraphs below to achieve a good security level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual settings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verifying certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling the `SSLContext` constructor directly, `CERT_NONE` is the\n",
    "default. Since it does not authenticate the other peer, it can be\n",
    "insecure, especially in client mode where most of time you would like to\n",
    "ensure the authenticity of the server you're talking to. Therefore, when\n",
    "in client mode, it is highly recommended to use `CERT_REQUIRED`.\n",
    "However, it is in itself not sufficient; you also have to check that the\n",
    "server certificate, which can be obtained by calling\n",
    "`SSLSocket.getpeercert`, matches the desired service. For many protocols\n",
    "and applications, the service can be identified by the hostname; in this\n",
    "case, the `match_hostname` function can be used. This common check is\n",
    "automatically performed when `SSLContext.check_hostname` is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 Hostname matchings is now performed by OpenSSL. Python no longer\n",
    "uses `match_hostname`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In server mode, if you want to authenticate your clients using the SSL\n",
    "layer (rather than using a higher-level authentication mechanism),\n",
    "you'll also have to specify `CERT_REQUIRED` and similarly check the\n",
    "client certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Protocol versions\n",
    "\n",
    "SSL versions 2 and 3 are considered insecure and are therefore dangerous\n",
    "to use. If you want maximum compatibility between clients and servers,\n",
    "it is recommended to use `PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT` or `PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER`\n",
    "as the protocol version. SSLv2 and SSLv3 are disabled by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> client_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)\n",
    "    >>> client_context.minimum_version = ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1_3\n",
    "    >>> client_context.maximum_version = ssl.TLSVersion.TLSv1_3\n",
    "\n",
    "The SSL context created above will only allow TLSv1.2 and later (if\n",
    "supported by your system) connections to a server. `PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT`\n",
    "implies certificate validation and hostname checks by default. You have\n",
    "to load certificates into the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cipher selection\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have advanced security requirements, fine-tuning of the ciphers\n",
    "enabled when negotiating a SSL session is possible through the\n",
    "`SSLContext.set_ciphers` method. Starting from Python 3.2.3, the ssl\n",
    "module disables certain weak ciphers by default, but you may want to\n",
    "further restrict the cipher choice. Be sure to read OpenSSL's\n",
    "documentation about the [cipher list\n",
    "format](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT).\n",
    "If you want to check which ciphers are enabled by a given cipher list,\n",
    "use `SSLContext.get_ciphers` or the `openssl ciphers` command on your\n",
    "system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "If using this module as part of a multi-processed application (using,\n",
    "for example the `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` modules), be\n",
    "aware that OpenSSL's internal random number generator does not properly\n",
    "handle forked processes. Applications must change the PRNG state of the\n",
