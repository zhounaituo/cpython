    "# `code` --- Interpreter base classes\n",
    "\n",
    "code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source code:** `Lib/code.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `code` module provides facilities to implement read-eval-print loops\n",
    "in Python. Two classes and convenience functions are included which can\n",
    "be used to build applications which provide an interactive interpreter\n",
    "prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class deals with parsing and interpreter state (the user's\n",
    "namespace); it does not deal with input buffering or prompting or input\n",
    "file naming (the filename is always passed in explicitly). The optional\n",
    "*locals* argument specifies the dictionary in which code will be\n",
    "executed; it defaults to a newly created dictionary with key\n",
    "`'__name__'` set to `'__console__'` and key `'__doc__'` set to `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely emulate the behavior of the interactive Python interpreter. This\n",
    "class builds on `InteractiveInterpreter` and adds prompting using the\n",
    "familiar `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2`, and input buffering.\n",
    "\n",
    "interact(banner=None, readfunc=None, local=None, exitmsg=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convenience function to run a read-eval-print loop. This creates a new\n",
    "instance of `InteractiveConsole` and sets *readfunc* to be used as the\n",
    "`InteractiveConsole.raw_input` method, if provided. If *local* is\n",
    "provided, it is passed to the `InteractiveConsole` constructor for use\n",
    "as the default namespace for the interpreter loop. The `interact` method\n",
    "of the instance is then run with *banner* and *exitmsg* passed as the\n",
    "banner and exit message to use, if provided. The console object is\n",
    "discarded after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 Added *exitmsg* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "compile_command(source, filename=\"\\<input\\>\", symbol=\"single\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is useful for programs that want to emulate Python's\n",
    "interpreter main loop (a.k.a. the read-eval-print loop). The tricky part\n",
    "is to determine when the user has entered an incomplete command that can\n",
    "be completed by entering more text (as opposed to a complete command or\n",
    "a syntax error). This function *almost* always makes the same decision\n",
    "as the real interpreter main loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "*source* is the source string; *filename* is the optional filename from\n",
    "which source was read, defaulting to `'<input>'`; and *symbol* is the\n",
    "optional grammar start symbol, which should be `'single'` (the default),\n",
    "`'eval'` or `'exec'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a code object (the same as `compile(source, filename, symbol)`)\n",
    "if the command is complete and valid; `None` if the command is\n",
    "incomplete; raises `SyntaxError` if the command is complete and contains\n",
    "a syntax error, or raises `OverflowError` or `ValueError` if the command\n",
    "contains an invalid literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Interpreter Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "InteractiveInterpreter.runsource(source, filename=\"\\<input\\>\",\n",
    "symbol=\"single\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Compile and run some source in the interpreter. Arguments are the same\n",
    "as for `compile_command`; the default for *filename* is `'<input>'`, and\n",
    "for *symbol* is `'single'`. One of several things can happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The input is incorrect; `compile_command` raised an exception\n",
    "    (`SyntaxError` or `OverflowError`). A syntax traceback will be\n",
    "    printed by calling the `showsyntaxerror` method. `runsource` returns\n",
    "    `False`.\n",
    "-   The input is incomplete, and more input is required;\n",
    "    `compile_command` returned `None`. `runsource` returns `True`.\n",
    "-   The input is complete; `compile_command` returned a code object. The\n",
    "    code is executed by calling the `runcode` (which also handles\n",
    "    run-time exceptions, except for `SystemExit`). `runsource` returns\n",
    "    `False`.\n",
    "\n",

    "called to display a traceback. All exceptions are caught except\n",
    "`SystemExit`, which is allowed to propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note about `KeyboardInterrupt`: this exception may occur elsewhere in\n",
    "this code, and may not always be caught. The caller should be prepared\n",
    "to deal with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "InteractiveInterpreter.showsyntaxerror(filename=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the syntax error that just occurred. This does not display a\n",
    "stack trace because there isn't one for syntax errors. If *filename* is\n",
    "given, it is stuffed into the exception instead of the default filename\n",
    "provided by Python's parser, because it always uses `'<string>'` when\n",
    "reading from a string. The output is written by the `write` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "InteractiveInterpreter.showtraceback()\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the exception that just occurred. We remove the first stack item\n",
    "because it is within the interpreter object implementation. The output\n",
    "is written by the `write` method.\n",

    "traceback.\n",

    "as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Console Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The `InteractiveConsole` class is a subclass of\n",
    "`InteractiveInterpreter`, and so offers all the methods of the\n",
    "interpreter objects as well as the following additions.\n",
    "\n",
    "InteractiveConsole.interact(banner=None, exitmsg=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely emulate the interactive Python console. The optional *banner*\n",
    "argument specify the banner to print before the first interaction; by\n",
    "default it prints a banner similar to the one printed by the standard\n",
    "Python interpreter, followed by the class name of the console object in\n",
    "parentheses (so as not to confuse this with the real interpreter --\n",
    "since it's so close!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional *exitmsg* argument specifies an exit message printed when\n",
    "exiting. Pass the empty string to suppress the exit message. If\n",
    "*exitmsg* is not given or `None`, a default message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 To suppress printing any banner, pass an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 Print an exit message when exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "InteractiveConsole.push(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Push a line of source text to the interpreter. The line should not have\n",
    "a trailing newline; it may have internal newlines. The line is appended\n",
    "to a buffer and the interpreter's `runsource` method is called with the\n",
    "concatenated contents of the buffer as source. If this indicates that\n",
    "the command was executed or invalid, the buffer is reset; otherwise, the\n",
    "command is incomplete, and the buffer is left as it was after the line\n",
    "was appended. The return value is `True` if more input is required,\n",
    "`False` if the line was dealt with in some way (this is the same as\n",

    "InteractiveConsole.raw_input(prompt=\"\")\n",

    "Write a prompt and read a line. The returned line does not include the\n",
    "trailing newline. When the user enters the EOF key sequence, `EOFError`\n",
    "is raised. The base implementation reads from `sys.stdin`; a subclass\n",
    "may replace this with a different implementation."
