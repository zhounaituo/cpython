    "This module provides some utility functions to support installing Python\n",
    "libraries. These functions compile Python source files in a directory\n",
    "tree. This module can be used to create the cached byte-code files at\n",
    "library installation time, which makes them available for use even by\n",
    "users who don't have write permission to the library directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Command-line use\n",
