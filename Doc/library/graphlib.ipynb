    "Provides functionality to topologically sort a graph of hashable nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A topological order is a linear ordering of the vertices in a graph such\n",
    "that for every directed edge u -\\> v from vertex u to vertex v, vertex u\n",
    "comes before vertex v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the\n",
    "graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent\n",
    "constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this\n",
    "example, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks.\n",
    "A complete topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has\n",
    "no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the optional *graph* argument is provided it must be a dictionary\n",
    "representing a directed acyclic graph where the keys are nodes and the\n",
    "values are iterables of all predecessors of that node in the graph (the\n",
    "nodes that have edges that point to the value in the key). Additional\n",
    "nodes can be added to the graph using the `~TopologicalSorter.add`\n",
    "method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general case, the steps required to perform the sorting of a\n",
    "given graph are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> -   Create an instance of the `TopologicalSorter` with an optional\n",
    ">     initial graph.\n",
    "> -   Add additional nodes to the graph.\n",
    "> -   Call `~TopologicalSorter.prepare` on the graph.\n",
    "> -   While `~TopologicalSorter.is_active` is `True`, iterate over the\n",
    ">     nodes returned by `~TopologicalSorter.get_ready` and process them.\n",
    ">     Call `~TopologicalSorter.done` on each node as it finishes\n",
    ">     processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case just an immediate sorting of the nodes in the graph is required\n",
    "and no parallelism is involved, the convenience method\n",
