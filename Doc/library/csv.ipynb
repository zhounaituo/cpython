    "The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common\n",
    "import and export format for spreadsheets and databases. CSV format was\n",
    "used for many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a\n",
    "standardized way in `4180`. The lack of a well-defined standard means\n",
    "that subtle differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by\n",
    "different applications. These differences can make it annoying to\n",
    "process CSV files from multiple sources. Still, while the delimiters and\n",

    "The `csv` module implements classes to read and write tabular data in\n",

    "preferred by Excel,\" or \"read data from this file which was generated by\n",
    "Excel,\" without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by\n",
    "Excel. Programmers can also describe the CSV formats understood by other\n",

    "\n",
    "reader(csvfile, dialect='excel', \\*\\*fmtparams)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a reader object which will iterate over lines in the given\n",

    "protocol and returns a string each time its `!__next__` method is called\n",
    "--- `file objects\n",
    "<file object>` and list objects are both suitable. If *csvfile* is a\n",
    "file object, it should be opened with `newline=''`.[1] An optional\n",
    "*dialect* parameter can be given which is used to define a set of\n",
    "parameters specific to a particular CSV dialect. It may be an instance\n",
    "of a subclass of the `Dialect` class or one of the strings returned by\n",
    "the `list_dialects` function. The other optional *fmtparams* keyword\n",
    "arguments can be given to override individual formatting parameters in\n",
    "the current dialect. For full details about the dialect and formatting\n",
    "parameters, see section `csv-fmt-params`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings. No\n",
    "automatic data type conversion is performed unless the\n",
    "`QUOTE_NONNUMERIC` format option is specified (in which case unquoted\n",
