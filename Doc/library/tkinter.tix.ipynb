    "The `tkinter.tix` (Tk Interface Extension) module provides an additional\n",
    "rich set of widgets. Although the standard Tk library has many useful\n",
    "widgets, they are far from complete. The `tkinter.tix` library provides\n",
    "most of the commonly needed widgets that are missing from standard Tk:\n",
    "`HList`, `ComboBox`, `Control` (a.k.a. SpinBox) and an assortment of\n",
    "scrollable widgets. `tkinter.tix` also includes many more widgets that\n",
    "are generally useful in a wide range of applications: `NoteBook`,\n",
    "`FileEntry`, `PanedWindow`, etc; there are more than 40 of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these new widgets, you can introduce new interaction techniques\n",
    "into applications, creating more useful and more intuitive user\n",
    "interfaces. You can design your application by choosing the most\n",
    "appropriate widgets to match the special needs of your application and\n",

    "\n",
    "Toplevel widget of Tix which represents mostly the main window of an\n",

    "\n",
    "Classes in the `tkinter.tix` module subclasses the classes in the\n",
    "`tkinter`. The former imports the latter, so to use `tkinter.tix` with\n",
    "Tkinter, all you need to do is to import one module. In general, you can\n",

    "\n",

    "alongside your installation of the Tk widgets. To test your\n",
    "installation, try the following:\n",

    "pop-up window with a descriptive message will be shown on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",

    "\n",
    "The\n",
    "[ComboBox](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixComboBox.htm)\n",
    "widget is similar to the combo box control in MS Windows. The user can\n",
    "select a choice by either typing in the entry subwidget or selecting\n",
    "from the listbox subwidget.\n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",
    "[Control](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixControl.htm)\n",
    "widget is also known as the `SpinBox` widget. The user can adjust the\n",
    "value by pressing the two arrow buttons or by entering the value\n",
    "directly into the entry. The new value will be checked against the\n",
    "user-defined upper and lower limits.\n",

    "The\n",
    "[Select](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixSelect.htm)\n",

    "to select the desired directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DirSelectBox` is similar to the standard Motif(TM)\n",

    "on MS Windows 3.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",
    "[FileSelectBox](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixFileSelectBox.htm)\n",

    "[CheckList](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixCheckList.htm)\n",
    "widget displays a list of items to be selected by the user. CheckList\n",
    "acts similarly to the Tk checkbutton or radiobutton widgets, except it\n",

    "The\n",
    "[TList](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixTList.htm)\n",
    "widget can be used to display data in a tabular format. The list entries\n",

    "[ListNoteBook](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixListNoteBook.htm)\n",
    "widget is very similar to the `TixNoteBook` widget: it can be used to\n",
    "display many windows in a limited space using a notebook metaphor. The\n",
    "notebook is divided into a stack of pages (windows). At one time only\n",

    "### Image Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tkinter.tix` module adds:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [pixmap](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/pixmap.htm)\n",
    "    capabilities to all `tkinter.tix` and `tkinter` widgets to create\n",

    "-   [Compound](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/compound.htm)\n",
    "    image types can be used to create images that consists of multiple\n",
    "    horizontal lines; each line is composed of a series of items (texts,\n",
    "    bitmaps, images or spaces) arranged from left to right. For example,\n",
    "    a compound image can be used to display a bitmap and a text string\n",
    "    simultaneously in a Tk `Button` widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellaneous Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",
    "[InputOnly](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixInputOnly.htm)\n",
    "widgets are to accept inputs from the user, which can be done with the\n",
    "`bind` command (Unix only).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form Geometry Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, `tkinter.tix` augments `tkinter` by providing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The\n",
    "[Form](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tixForm.htm)\n",

    "## Tix Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The [tix\n",
    "commands](http://tix.sourceforge.net/dist/current/man/html/TixCmd/tix.htm)\n",
    "provide access to miscellaneous elements of `Tix`'s internal state and\n",
    "the `Tix` application context. Most of the information manipulated by\n",
    "these methods pertains to the application as a whole, or to a screen or\n",
    "display, rather than to a particular window.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Query or modify the configuration options of the Tix application\n",
    "context. If no option is specified, returns a dictionary all of the\n",
    "available options. If option is specified with no value, then the method\n",
    "returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be\n",
    "identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no\n",
    "option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n",
    "then the method modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s);\n",

    "the configuration options.\n",
    "\n",
    "tixCommand.tix_cget(option)\n",

    "\n",
    "Locates a bitmap file of the name `name.xpm` or `name` in one of the\n",
    "bitmap directories (see the `tix_addbitmapdir` method). By using\n",
    "`tix_getbitmap`, you can avoid hard coding the pathnames of the bitmap\n",
    "files in your application. When successful, it returns the complete\n",
    "pathname of the bitmap file, prefixed with the character `@`. The\n",

    "\n",
    "Tix maintains a list of directories under which the `tix_getimage` and\n",

    "directory is `$TIX_LIBRARY/bitmaps`. The `tix_addbitmapdir` method adds\n",
    "*directory* into this list. By using this method, the image files of an\n",

    "dialog widget when it is called the first time. This dialog will be\n",
    "returned by all subsequent calls to `tix_filedialog`. An optional\n",
    "dlgclass parameter can be passed as a string to specified what type of\n",

    "Tix widgets.\n",
    "\n",
