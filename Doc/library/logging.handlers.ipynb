    "The following useful handlers are provided in the package. Note that\n",
    "three of the handlers (`StreamHandler`, `FileHandler` and `NullHandler`)\n",
    "are actually defined in the `logging` module itself, but have been\n",
    "documented here along with the other handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## StreamHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StreamHandler` class, located in the core `logging` package, sends\n",
    "logging output to streams such as *sys.stdout*, *sys.stderr* or any\n",
    "file-like object (or, more precisely, any object which supports `write`\n",
    "and `flush` methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a new instance of the `StreamHandler` class. If *stream* is\n",
    "specified, the instance will use it for logging output; otherwise,\n",
    "*sys.stderr* will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "emit(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a formatter is specified, it is used to format the record. The record\n",
    "is then written to the stream followed by `terminator`. If exception\n",
    "information is present, it is formatted using\n",
    "`traceback.print_exception` and appended to the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "flush()\n",
    "\n",
    "Flushes the stream by calling its `flush` method. Note that the `close`\n",
    "method is inherited from `~logging.Handler` and so does no output, so an\n",
    "explicit `flush` call may be needed at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "setStream(stream)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets the instance's stream to the specified value, if it is different.\n",
    "The old stream is flushed before the new stream is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "param stream  \n",

    "\n",
    "String used as the terminator when writing a formatted record to a\n",
    "stream. Default value is `'\\n'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want a newline termination, you can set the handler\n",
    "instance's `terminator` attribute to the empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier versions, the terminator was hardcoded as `'\\n'`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## FileHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FileHandler` class, located in the core `logging` package, sends\n",
    "logging output to a disk file. It inherits the output functionality from\n",
    "`StreamHandler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a new instance of the `FileHandler` class. The specified file is\n",
    "opened and used as the stream for logging. If *mode* is not specified,\n",
    "`'a'` is used. If *encoding* is not `None`, it is used to open the file\n",
    "with that encoding. If *delay* is true, then file opening is deferred\n",
    "until the first call to `emit`. By default, the file grows indefinitely.\n",
    "If *errors* is specified, it's used to determine how encoding errors are\n",
    "handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 As well as string values, `~pathlib.Path` objects are also accepted\n",
    "for the *filename* argument.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "close()\n",

    "Closes the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "emit(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs the record to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the file was closed due to logging shutdown at exit and the\n",
    "file mode is 'w', the record will not be emitted (see `42378`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## NullHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NullHandler` class, located in the core `logging` package, does not\n",
    "do any formatting or output. It is essentially a 'no-op' handler for use\n",
    "by library developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a new instance of the `NullHandler` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "emit(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method does nothing.\n",

    "\n",
    "This method does nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "createLock()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns `None` for the lock, since there is no underlying\n",
    "I/O to which access needs to be serialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `library-config` for more information on how to use `NullHandler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## WatchedFileHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WatchedFileHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers`\n",
    "module, is a `FileHandler` which watches the file it is logging to. If\n",
    "the file changes, it is closed and reopened using the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "A file change can happen because of usage of programs such as\n",
    "*newsyslog* and *logrotate* which perform log file rotation. This\n",
    "handler, intended for use under Unix/Linux, watches the file to see if\n",
    "it has changed since the last emit. (A file is deemed to have changed if\n",
    "its device or inode have changed.) If the file has changed, the old file\n",
    "stream is closed, and the file opened to get a new stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "This handler is not appropriate for use under Windows, because under\n",
    "Windows open log files cannot be moved or renamed - logging opens the\n",
    "files with exclusive locks - and so there is no need for such a handler.\n",
    "Furthermore, *ST_INO* is not supported under Windows; `~os.stat` always\n",
    "returns zero for this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a new instance of the `WatchedFileHandler` class. The specified\n",
    "file is opened and used as the stream for logging. If *mode* is not\n",
    "specified, `'a'` is used. If *encoding* is not `None`, it is used to\n",
    "open the file with that encoding. If *delay* is true, then file opening\n",
    "is deferred until the first call to `emit`. By default, the file grows\n",
    "indefinitely. If *errors* is provided, it determines how encoding errors\n",
    "are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 As well as string values, `~pathlib.Path` objects are also accepted\n",
    "for the *filename* argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.9 The *errors* parameter was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "reopenIfNeeded()\n",
    "\n",
    "Checks to see if the file has changed. If it has, the existing stream is\n",
    "flushed and closed and the file opened again, typically as a precursor\n",
    "to outputting the record to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6\n",
    "\n",
    "emit(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs the record to the file, but first calls `reopenIfNeeded` to\n",
    "reopen the file if it has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BaseRotatingHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BaseRotatingHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers`\n",
    "module, is the base class for the rotating file handlers,\n",
    "`RotatingFileHandler` and `TimedRotatingFileHandler`. You should not\n",
    "need to instantiate this class, but it has attributes and methods you\n",
    "may need to override.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters are as for `FileHandler`. The attributes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "namer\n",
    "\n",
    "If this attribute is set to a callable, the `rotation_filename` method\n",
    "delegates to this callable. The parameters passed to the callable are\n",
    "those passed to `rotation_filename`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The namer function is called quite a few times during rollover, so it\n",
    "should be as simple and as fast as possible. It should also return the\n",
    "same output every time for a given input, otherwise the rollover\n",
    "behaviour may not work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth noting that care should be taken when using a namer to\n",
    "preserve certain attributes in the filename which are used during\n",
    "rotation. For example, `RotatingFileHandler` expects to have a set of\n",
    "log files whose names contain successive integers, so that rotation\n",
    "works as expected, and `TimedRotatingFileHandler` deletes old log files\n",
    "(based on the `backupCount` parameter passed to the handler's\n",
    "initializer) by determining the oldest files to delete. For this to\n",
    "happen, the filenames should be sortable using the date/time portion of\n",
    "the filename, and a namer needs to respect this. (If a namer is wanted\n",
    "that doesn't respect this scheme, it will need to be used in a subclass\n",
    "of `TimedRotatingFileHandler` which overrides the\n",
    "`~TimedRotatingFileHandler.getFilesToDelete` method to fit in with the\n",
    "custom naming scheme.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "BaseRotatingHandler.rotator\n",
    "\n",
    "If this attribute is set to a callable, the `rotate` method delegates to\n",
    "this callable. The parameters passed to the callable are those passed to\n",

    "\n",
    "BaseRotatingHandler.rotation_filename(default_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default implementation calls the 'namer' attribute of the handler,\n",
    "if it's callable, passing the default name to it. If the attribute isn't\n",
    "callable (the default is `None`), the name is returned unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "param default_name  \n",
    "The default name for the log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "BaseRotatingHandler.rotate(source, dest)\n",
    "\n",
    "When rotating, rotate the current log.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default implementation calls the 'rotator' attribute of the handler,\n",
    "if it's callable, passing the source and dest arguments to it. If the\n",
    "attribute isn't callable (the default is `None`), the source is simply\n",
    "renamed to the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "param source  \n",
    "The source filename. This is normally the base filename, e.g.\n",
    "'test.log'.\n",
    "\n",
    "param dest  \n",
    "The destination filename. This is normally what the source is rotated\n",
    "to, e.g. 'test.log.1'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the attributes exist is to save you having to subclass - you\n",
    "can use the same callables for instances of `RotatingFileHandler` and\n",
    "`TimedRotatingFileHandler`. If either the namer or rotator callable\n",
    "raises an exception, this will be handled in the same way as any other\n",
    "exception during an `emit` call, i.e. via the `handleError` method of\n",
    "the handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to make more significant changes to rotation processing, you\n",
    "can override the methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example, see `cookbook-rotator-namer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RotatingFileHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RotatingFileHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers`\n",

    "exceeded, the file is closed and a new file is silently opened for\n",
    "output. Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is nearly\n",
    "*maxBytes* in length; but if either of *maxBytes* or *backupCount* is\n",
    "zero, rollover never occurs, so you generally want to set *backupCount*\n",
    "to at least 1, and have a non-zero *maxBytes*. When *backupCount* is\n",
    "non-zero, the system will save old log files by appending the extensions\n",
    "'.1', '.2' etc., to the filename. For example, with a *backupCount* of 5\n",
    "and a base file name of `app.log`, you would get `app.log`, `app.log.1`,\n",
    "`app.log.2`, up to `app.log.5`. The file being written to is always\n",
    "`app.log`. When this file is filled, it is closed and renamed to\n",
    "`app.log.1`, and if files `app.log.1`, `app.log.2`, etc. exist, then\n",
    "they are renamed to `app.log.2`, `app.log.3` etc. respectively.\n",
