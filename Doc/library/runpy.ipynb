    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `runpy` module is used to locate and run Python modules without\n",
    "importing them first. Its main use is to implement the `-m` command line\n",
    "switch that allows scripts to be located using the Python module\n",
    "namespace rather than the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is *not* a sandbox module - all code is executed in the\n",
    "current process, and any side effects (such as cached imports of other\n",
    "modules) will remain in place after the functions have returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, any functions and classes defined by the executed code are\n",
    "not guaranteed to work correctly after a `runpy` function has returned.\n",
    "If that limitation is not acceptable for a given use case, `importlib`\n",
    "is likely to be a more suitable choice than this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `runpy` module provides two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "run_module(mod_name, init_globals=None, run_name=None, alter_sys=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "module: \\_\\_main\\_\\_\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the code of the specified module and return the resulting module\n",
    "globals dictionary. The module's code is first located using the\n",
    "standard import mechanism (refer to `302` for details) and then executed\n",
    "in a fresh module namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *mod_name* argument should be an absolute module name. If the module\n",
    "name refers to a package rather than a normal module, then that package\n",
    "is imported and the `__main__` submodule within that package is then\n",
    "executed and the resulting module globals dictionary returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional dictionary argument *init_globals* may be used to\n",
    "pre-populate the module's globals dictionary before the code is\n",
    "executed. The supplied dictionary will not be modified. If any of the\n",
    "special global variables below are defined in the supplied dictionary,\n",
    "those definitions are overridden by `run_module`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The special global variables `__name__`, `__spec__`, `__file__`,\n",
    "`__cached__`, `__loader__` and `__package__` are set in the globals\n",
    "dictionary before the module code is executed (Note that this is a\n",
    "minimal set of variables - other variables may be set implicitly as an\n",
    "interpreter implementation detail).\n",
    "\n",
    "`__name__` is set to *run_name* if this optional argument is not `None`,\n",
    "to `mod_name + '.__main__'` if the named module is a package and to the\n",
    "*mod_name* argument otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__spec__` will be set appropriately for the *actually* imported module\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that this manipulation of `sys` is not thread-safe. Other threads\n",
    "may see the partially initialised module, as well as the altered list of\n",
