    "The `Message` class is very similar to the `~email.message.EmailMessage`\n",

    "\n",
    "An email message consists of *headers* and a *payload*. Headers must be\n",
    "`5322` style names and values, where the field name and value are\n",
    "separated by a colon. The colon is not part of either the field name or\n",
    "the field value. The payload may be a simple text message, or a binary\n",
    "object, or a structured sequence of sub-messages each with their own set\n",
    "of headers and their own payload. The latter type of payload is\n",
    "indicated by the message having a MIME type such as `multipart/\\*` or\n",
    "`message/rfc822`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conceptual model provided by a `Message` object is that of an\n",

    "handling for non-ASCII input, but it doesn't always produce the correct\n",
    "results. Headers are stored and returned in case-preserving form, but\n",
    "field names are matched case-insensitively. There may also be a single\n",
