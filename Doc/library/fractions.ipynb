    "The `fractions` module provides support for rational number arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Fraction instance can be constructed from a pair of integers, from\n",
    "another rational number, or from a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version requires that *numerator* and *denominator* are\n",
    "instances of `numbers.Rational` and returns a new `Fraction` instance\n",
    "with value `numerator/denominator`. If *denominator* is `0`, it raises a\n",
    "`ZeroDivisionError`. The second version requires that *other_fraction*\n",
    "is an instance of `numbers.Rational` and returns a `Fraction` instance\n",
    "with the same value. The next two versions accept either a `float` or a\n",
    "`decimal.Decimal` instance, and return a `Fraction` instance with\n",
    "exactly the same value. Note that due to the usual issues with binary\n",
    "floating-point (see `tut-fp-issues`), the argument to `Fraction(1.1)` is\n",
    "not exactly equal to 11/10, and so `Fraction(1.1)` does *not* return\n",
    "`Fraction(11, 10)` as one might expect. (But see the documentation for\n",
    "the `limit_denominator` method below.) The last version of the\n",
    "constructor expects a string or unicode instance. The usual form for\n",
    "this instance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [sign] numerator ['/' denominator]\n",
    "\n",
    "where the optional `sign` may be either '+' or '-' and `numerator` and\n",
    "`denominator` (if present) are strings of decimal digits (underscores\n",
    "may be used to delimit digits as with integral literals in code). In\n",
    "addition, any string that represents a finite value and is accepted by\n",
    "the `float` constructor is also accepted by the `Fraction` constructor.\n",
    "In either form the input string may also have leading and/or trailing\n",
    "whitespace. Here are some examples:\n",

    "`numbers.Rational`, and implements all of the methods and operations\n",
