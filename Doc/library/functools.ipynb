    "The `functools` module is for higher-order functions: functions that act\n",
    "on or return other functions. In general, any callable object can be\n",
    "treated as a function for the purposes of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `functools` module defines the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "cache(user_function)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple lightweight unbounded function cache. Sometimes called\n",
    "[\"memoize\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns the same as `lru_cache(maxsize=None)`, creating a thin wrapper\n",
    "around a dictionary lookup for the function arguments. Because it never\n",
    "needs to evict old values, this is smaller and faster than `lru_cache()`\n",
    "with a size limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    @cache\n",
    "    def factorial(n):\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n-1) if n else 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> factorial(10)      # no previously cached result, makes 11 recursive calls\n",
    "    3628800\n",
    "    >>> factorial(5)       # just looks up cached value result\n",
    "    120\n",
    "    >>> factorial(12)      # makes two new recursive calls, the other 10 are cached\n",
    "    479001600\n",
    "\n",
    "3.9\n",
    "\n",
    "cached_property(func)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform a method of a class into a property whose value is computed\n",
    "once and then cached as a normal attribute for the life of the instance.\n",
    "Similar to `property`, with the addition of caching. Useful for\n",
    "expensive computed properties of instances that are otherwise\n",
    "effectively immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class DataSet:\n",
    "\n",
    "        def __init__(self, sequence_of_numbers):\n",
    "            self._data = tuple(sequence_of_numbers)\n",

    "            return statistics.stdev(self._data)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanics of `cached_property` are somewhat different from\n",
    "`property`. A regular property blocks attribute writes unless a setter\n",
    "is defined. In contrast, a *cached_property* allows writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *cached_property* decorator only runs on lookups and only when an\n",
    "attribute of the same name doesn't exist. When it does run, the\n",
    "*cached_property* writes to the attribute with the same name. Subsequent\n",
    "attribute reads and writes take precedence over the *cached_property*\n",
    "method and it works like a normal attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cached value can be cleared by deleting the attribute. This allows\n",
    "the *cached_property* method to run again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, this decorator interferes with the operation of `412` key-sharing\n",
    "dictionaries. This means that instance dictionaries can take more space\n",
    "than usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this decorator requires that the `__dict__` attribute on each\n",
    "instance be a mutable mapping. This means it will not work with some\n",
    "types, such as metaclasses (since the `__dict__` attributes on type\n",
    "instances are read-only proxies for the class namespace), and those that\n",
    "specify `__slots__` without including `__dict__` as one of the defined\n",
    "slots (as such classes don't provide a `__dict__` attribute at all).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a mutable mapping is not available or if space-efficient key sharing\n",
    "is desired, an effect similar to `cached_property` can be achieved by a\n",
    "stacking `property` on top of `cache`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class DataSet:\n",
