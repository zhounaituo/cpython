    "> Similar to `map(func, *iterables) <map>` except:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> -   the *iterables* are collected immediately rather than lazily;\n",
    "> -   *func* is executed asynchronously and several calls to *func* may\n",
    ">     be made concurrently.\n",

    "> The returned iterator raises a `TimeoutError` if `~iterator.__next__`\n",
