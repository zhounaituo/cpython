    "**Source code:** `Lib/optparse.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 The `optparse` module is deprecated and will not be developed\n",
    "further; development will continue with the `argparse` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`optparse` is a more convenient, flexible, and powerful library for\n",
    "parsing command-line options than the old `getopt` module. `optparse`\n",
    "uses a more declarative style of command-line parsing: you create an\n",
    "instance of `OptionParser`, populate it with options, and parse the\n",
    "command line. `optparse` allows users to specify options in the\n",
    "conventional GNU/POSIX syntax, and additionally generates usage and help\n",
    "messages for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using `optparse` in a simple script:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from optparse import OptionParser\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    parser = OptionParser()\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-f\", \"--file\", dest=\"filename\",\n",
    "                      help=\"write report to FILE\", metavar=\"FILE\")\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-q\", \"--quiet\",\n",
    "                      action=\"store_false\", dest=\"verbose\", default=True,\n",
    "                      help=\"don't print status messages to stdout\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    (options, args) = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "With these few lines of code, users of your script can now do the \"usual\n",
    "thing\" on the command-line, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <yourscript> --file=outfile -q\n",
    "\n",
    "As it parses the command line, `optparse` sets attributes of the\n",
    "`options` object returned by `parse_args` based on user-supplied\n",
    "command-line values. When `parse_args` returns from parsing this command\n",
    "line, `options.filename` will be `\"outfile\"` and `options.verbose` will\n",
    "be `False`. `optparse` supports both long and short options, allows\n",
    "short options to be merged together, and allows options to be associated\n",
    "with their arguments in a variety of ways. Thus, the following command\n",
    "lines are all equivalent to the above example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <yourscript> -f outfile --quiet\n",
    "    <yourscript> --quiet --file outfile\n",
    "    <yourscript> -q -foutfile\n",
    "    <yourscript> -qfoutfile\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, users can run one of the following :\n",
    "\n",
    "    <yourscript> -h\n",
    "    <yourscript> --help\n",
    "\n",
    "and `optparse` will print out a brief summary of your script's options:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "Usage: <yourscript> [options]\n",
    "\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n",
    "  -f FILE, --file=FILE  write report to FILE\n",
    "  -q, --quiet           don't print status messages to stdout\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the value of *yourscript* is determined at runtime (normally from\n",
    "`sys.argv[0]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "`optparse` was explicitly designed to encourage the creation of programs\n",
    "with straightforward, conventional command-line interfaces. To that end,\n",
    "it supports only the most common command-line syntax and semantics\n",
    "conventionally used under Unix. If you are unfamiliar with these\n",
    "conventions, read this section to acquaint yourself with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "argument  \n",
    "a string entered on the command-line, and passed by the shell to\n",
    "`execl()` or `execv()`. In Python, arguments are elements of\n",
    "`sys.argv[1:]` (`sys.argv[0]` is the name of the program being\n",
    "executed). Unix shells also use the term \"word\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is occasionally desirable to substitute an argument list other than\n",
    "`sys.argv[1:]`, so you should read \"argument\" as \"an element of\n",
    "`sys.argv[1:]`, or of some other list provided as a substitute for\n",
    "`sys.argv[1:]`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "option  \n",
    "an argument used to supply extra information to guide or customize the\n",
    "execution of a program. There are many different syntaxes for options;\n",
    "the traditional Unix syntax is a hyphen (\"-\") followed by a single\n",
    "letter, e.g. `-x` or `-F`. Also, traditional Unix syntax allows multiple\n",
    "options to be merged into a single argument, e.g. `-x -F` is equivalent\n",
    "to `-xF`. The GNU project introduced `--` followed by a series of\n",
    "hyphen-separated words, e.g. `--file` or `--dry-run`. These are the only\n",
    "two option syntaxes provided by `optparse`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other option syntaxes that the world has seen include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   a hyphen followed by a few letters, e.g. `-pf` (this is *not* the\n",
    "    same as multiple options merged into a single argument)\n",
    "-   a hyphen followed by a whole word, e.g. `-file` (this is technically\n",
    "    equivalent to the previous syntax, but they aren't usually seen in\n",
    "    the same program)\n",
    "-   a plus sign followed by a single letter, or a few letters, or a\n",
    "    word, e.g. `+f`, `+rgb`\n",
    "-   a slash followed by a letter, or a few letters, or a word, e.g.\n",
    "    `/f`, `/file`\n",
    "\n",
    "These option syntaxes are not supported by `optparse`, and they never\n",
    "will be. This is deliberate: the first three are non-standard on any\n",
    "environment, and the last only makes sense if you're exclusively\n",
    "targeting Windows or certain legacy platforms (e.g. VMS, MS-DOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "option argument  \n",
    "an argument that follows an option, is closely associated with that\n",
    "option, and is consumed from the argument list when that option is. With\n",
    "`optparse`, option arguments may either be in a separate argument from\n",
    "their option:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "-f foo\n",
    "--file foo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or included in the same argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "-ffoo\n",
    "--file=foo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a given option either takes an argument or it doesn't. Lots\n",
    "of people want an \"optional option arguments\" feature, meaning that some\n",
    "options will take an argument if they see it, and won't if they don't.\n",
    "This is somewhat controversial, because it makes parsing ambiguous: if\n",
    "`-a` takes an optional argument and `-b` is another option entirely, how\n",
    "do we interpret `-ab`? Because of this ambiguity, `optparse` does not\n",
    "support this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "positional argument  \n",
    "something leftover in the argument list after options have been parsed,\n",
    "i.e. after options and their arguments have been parsed and removed from\n",
    "the argument list.\n",
    "\n",
    "required option  \n",
    "an option that must be supplied on the command-line; note that the\n",
    "phrase \"required option\" is self-contradictory in English. `optparse`\n",
    "doesn't prevent you from implementing required options, but doesn't give\n",
    "you much help at it either.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider this hypothetical command-line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    prog -v --report report.txt foo bar\n",
    "\n",
    "`-v` and `--report` are both options. Assuming that `--report` takes one\n",
    "argument, `report.txt` is an option argument. `foo` and `bar` are\n",
    "positional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are options for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Options are used to provide extra information to tune or customize the\n",
    "execution of a program. In case it wasn't clear, options are usually\n",
    "*optional*. A program should be able to run just fine with no options\n",
    "whatsoever. (Pick a random program from the Unix or GNU toolsets. Can it\n",
    "run without any options at all and still make sense? The main exceptions\n",
    "are `find`, `tar`, and `dd`---all of which are mutant oddballs that have\n",
    "been rightly criticized for their non-standard syntax and confusing\n",
    "interfaces.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of people want their programs to have \"required options\". Think\n",
    "about it. If it's required, then it's *not optional*! If there is a\n",
    "piece of information that your program absolutely requires in order to\n",
    "run successfully, that's what positional arguments are for.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of good command-line interface design, consider the humble\n",
    "`cp` utility, for copying files. It doesn't make much sense to try to\n",
    "copy files without supplying a destination and at least one source.\n",
    "Hence, `cp` fails if you run it with no arguments. However, it has a\n",
    "flexible, useful syntax that does not require any options at all:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cp SOURCE DEST\n",
    "    cp SOURCE ... DEST-DIR\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get pretty far with just that. Most `cp` implementations provide\n",
    "a bunch of options to tweak exactly how the files are copied: you can\n",
    "preserve mode and modification time, avoid following symlinks, ask\n",
    "before clobbering existing files, etc. But none of this distracts from\n",
    "the core mission of `cp`, which is to copy either one file to another,\n",
    "or several files to another directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are positional arguments for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional arguments are for those pieces of information that your\n",
    "program absolutely, positively requires to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good user interface should have as few absolute requirements as\n",
    "possible. If your program requires 17 distinct pieces of information in\n",
    "order to run successfully, it doesn't much matter *how* you get that\n",
    "information from the user---most people will give up and walk away\n",
    "before they successfully run the program. This applies whether the user\n",
    "interface is a command-line, a configuration file, or a GUI: if you make\n",
    "that many demands on your users, most of them will simply give up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, try to minimize the amount of information that users are\n",
    "absolutely required to supply---use sensible defaults whenever possible.\n",
    "Of course, you also want to make your programs reasonably flexible.\n",
    "That's what options are for. Again, it doesn't matter if they are\n",
    "entries in a config file, widgets in the \"Preferences\" dialog of a GUI,\n",
    "or command-line options---the more options you implement, the more\n",
    "flexible your program is, and the more complicated its implementation\n",
    "becomes. Too much flexibility has drawbacks as well, of course; too many\n",
    "options can overwhelm users and make your code much harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "While `optparse` is quite flexible and powerful, it's also\n",
    "straightforward to use in most cases. This section covers the code\n",
    "patterns that are common to any `optparse`-based program.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to import the OptionParser class; then, early in the\n",
    "main program, create an OptionParser instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from optparse import OptionParser\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    parser = OptionParser()\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can start defining options. The basic syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(opt_str, ...,\n",
    "                      attr=value, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each option has one or more option strings, such as `-f` or `--file`,\n",
    "and several option attributes that tell `optparse` what to expect and\n",
    "what to do when it encounters that option on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, each option will have one short option string and one long\n",
    "option string, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-f\", \"--file\", ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "You're free to define as many short option strings and as many long\n",
    "option strings as you like (including zero), as long as there is at\n",
    "least one option string overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The option strings passed to `OptionParser.add_option` are effectively\n",
    "labels for the option defined by that call. For brevity, we will\n",
    "frequently refer to *encountering an option* on the command line; in\n",
    "reality, `optparse` encounters *option strings* and looks up options\n",
    "from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of your options are defined, instruct `optparse` to parse your\n",
    "program's command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (options, args) = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you like, you can pass a custom argument list to `parse_args`, but\n",
    "that's rarely necessary: by default it uses `sys.argv[1:]`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`parse_args` returns two values:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `options`, an object containing values for all of your\n",
    "    options---e.g. if `--file` takes a single string argument, then\n",
    "    `options.file` will be the filename supplied by the user, or `None`\n",
    "    if the user did not supply that option\n",
    "-   `args`, the list of positional arguments leftover after parsing\n",
    "    options\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial section only covers the four most important option\n",
    "attributes: `~Option.action`, `~Option.type`, `~Option.dest`\n",
    "(destination), and `~Option.help`. Of these, `~Option.action` is the\n",
    "most fundamental.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding option actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions tell `optparse` what to do when it encounters an option on the\n",
    "command line. There is a fixed set of actions hard-coded into\n",
    "`optparse`; adding new actions is an advanced topic covered in section\n",
    "`optparse-extending-optparse`. Most actions tell `optparse` to store a\n",
    "value in some variable---for example, take a string from the command\n",
    "line and store it in an attribute of `options`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't specify an option action, `optparse` defaults to `store`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The store action\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common option action is `store`, which tells `optparse` to take\n",
    "the next argument (or the remainder of the current argument), ensure\n",
    "that it is of the correct type, and store it to your chosen destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-f\", \"--file\",\n",
    "                      action=\"store\", type=\"string\", dest=\"filename\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's make up a fake command line and ask `optparse` to parse it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    args = [\"-f\", \"foo.txt\"]\n",
    "    (options, args) = parser.parse_args(args)\n",
    "\n",
    "When `optparse` sees the option string `-f`, it consumes the next\n",
    "argument, `foo.txt`, and stores it in `options.filename`. So, after this\n",
    "call to `parse_args`, `options.filename` is `\"foo.txt\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other option types supported by `optparse` are `int` and `float`.\n",
    "Here's an option that expects an integer argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-n\", type=\"int\", dest=\"num\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this option has no long option string, which is perfectly\n",
    "acceptable. Also, there's no explicit action, since the default is\n",
    "`store`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's parse another fake command-line. This time, we'll jam the option\n",
    "argument right up against the option: since `-n42` (one argument) is\n",
    "equivalent to `-n 42` (two arguments), the code :\n",
    "\n",
    "    (options, args) = parser.parse_args([\"-n42\"])\n",
    "    print(options.num)\n",
    "\n",
    "will print `42`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't specify a type, `optparse` assumes `string`. Combined with\n",
    "the fact that the default action is `store`, that means our first\n",
    "example can be a lot shorter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-f\", \"--file\", dest=\"filename\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't supply a destination, `optparse` figures out a sensible\n",
    "default from the option strings: if the first long option string is\n",
    "`--foo-bar`, then the default destination is `foo_bar`. If there are no\n",
    "long option strings, `optparse` looks at the first short option string:\n",
    "the default destination for `-f` is `f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`optparse` also includes the built-in `complex` type. Adding types is\n",
    "covered in section `optparse-extending-optparse`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling boolean (flag) options\n",
    "\n",
    "Flag options---set a variable to true or false when a particular option\n",
    "is seen---are quite common. `optparse` supports them with two separate\n",
    "actions, `store_true` and `store_false`. For example, you might have a\n",
    "`verbose` flag that is turned on with `-v` and off with `-q`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-v\", action=\"store_true\", dest=\"verbose\")\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-q\", action=\"store_false\", dest=\"verbose\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have two different options with the same destination, which is\n",
    "perfectly OK. (It just means you have to be a bit careful when setting\n",
    "default values---see below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When `optparse` encounters `-v` on the command line, it sets\n",
    "`options.verbose` to `True`; when it encounters `-q`, `options.verbose`\n",
    "is set to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other actions supported by `optparse` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"store_const\"`  \n",
    "store a constant value\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"append\"`  \n",
    "append this option's argument to a list\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"count\"`  \n",
    "increment a counter by one\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"callback\"`  \n",
    "call a specified function\n",
    "\n",
    "These are covered in section `optparse-reference-guide`, and section\n",
    "`optparse-option-callbacks`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default values\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above examples involve setting some variable (the\n",
    "\"destination\") when certain command-line options are seen. What happens\n",
    "if those options are never seen? Since we didn't supply any defaults,\n",
    "they are all set to `None`. This is usually fine, but sometimes you want\n",
    "more control. `optparse` lets you supply a default value for each\n",
    "destination, which is assigned before the command line is parsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider the verbose/quiet example. If we want `optparse` to set\n",
    "`verbose` to `True` unless `-q` is seen, then we can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-v\", action=\"store_true\", dest=\"verbose\", default=True)\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-q\", action=\"store_false\", dest=\"verbose\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Since default values apply to the *destination* rather than to any\n",
    "particular option, and these two options happen to have the same\n",
    "destination, this is exactly equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-v\", action=\"store_true\", dest=\"verbose\")\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-q\", action=\"store_false\", dest=\"verbose\", default=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-v\", action=\"store_true\", dest=\"verbose\", default=False)\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-q\", action=\"store_false\", dest=\"verbose\", default=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the default value for `verbose` will be `True`: the last default\n",
    "value supplied for any particular destination is the one that counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A clearer way to specify default values is the `set_defaults` method of\n",
    "OptionParser, which you can call at any time before calling\n",
    "`parse_args`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.set_defaults(verbose=True)\n",
    "    parser.add_option(...)\n",
    "    (options, args) = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the last value specified for a given option destination is\n",
    "the one that counts. For clarity, try to use one method or the other of\n",
    "setting default values, not both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating help\n",
    "\n",
    "`optparse`'s ability to generate help and usage text automatically is\n",
    "useful for creating user-friendly command-line interfaces. All you have\n",
    "to do is supply a `~Option.help` value for each option, and optionally a\n",
    "short usage message for your whole program. Here's an OptionParser\n",
    "populated with user-friendly (documented) options:\n",
    "\n",
    "    usage = \"usage: %prog [options] arg1 arg2\"\n",
    "    parser = OptionParser(usage=usage)\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-v\", \"--verbose\",\n",
    "                      action=\"store_true\", dest=\"verbose\", default=True,\n",
    "                      help=\"make lots of noise [default]\")\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-q\", \"--quiet\",\n",

    "### Printing a version string\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the brief usage string, `optparse` can also print a version\n",
    "string for your program. You have to supply the string as the `version`\n",
    "argument to OptionParser:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser = OptionParser(usage=\"%prog [-f] [-q]\", version=\"%prog 1.0\")\n",
    "\n",
    "`%prog` is expanded just like it is in `usage`. Apart from that,\n",
    "`version` can contain anything you like. When you supply it, `optparse`\n",
    "automatically adds a `--version` option to your parser. If it encounters\n",
    "this option on the command line, it expands your `version` string (by\n",
    "replacing `%prog`), prints it to stdout, and exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your script is called `/usr/bin/foo`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell-session\n",
    "$ /usr/bin/foo --version\n",
    "foo 1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following two methods can be used to print and get the `version`\n",
    "string:\n",
    "\n",
    "OptionParser.print_version(file=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the version message for the current program (`self.version`) to\n",
    "*file* (default stdout). As with `print_usage`, any occurrence of\n",
    "`%prog` in `self.version` is replaced with the name of the current\n",
    "program. Does nothing if `self.version` is empty or undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "OptionParser.get_version()\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as `print_version` but returns the version string instead of\n",
    "printing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How `optparse` handles errors\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two broad classes of errors that `optparse` has to worry\n",
    "about: programmer errors and user errors. Programmer errors are usually\n",
    "erroneous calls to `OptionParser.add_option`, e.g. invalid option\n",
    "strings, unknown option attributes, missing option attributes, etc.\n",
    "These are dealt with in the usual way: raise an exception (either\n",
    "`optparse.OptionError` or `TypeError`) and let the program crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling user errors is much more important, since they are guaranteed\n",
    "to happen no matter how stable your code is. `optparse` can\n",
    "automatically detect some user errors, such as bad option arguments\n",
    "(passing `-n 4x` where `-n` takes an integer argument), missing\n",
    "arguments (`-n` at the end of the command line, where `-n` takes an\n",
    "argument of any type). Also, you can call `OptionParser.error` to signal\n",
    "an application-defined error condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (options, args) = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    if options.a and options.b:\n",
    "        parser.error(\"options -a and -b are mutually exclusive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, `optparse` handles the error the same way: it prints the\n",
    "program's usage message and an error message to standard error and exits\n",
    "with error status 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the first example above, where the user passes `4x` to an\n",
    "option that takes an integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell-session\n",
    "$ /usr/bin/foo -n 4x\n",
    "Usage: foo [options]\n",
    "\n",
    "foo: error: option -n: invalid integer value: '4x'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, where the user fails to pass a value at all:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell-session\n",
    "$ /usr/bin/foo -n\n",
    "Usage: foo [options]\n",
    "\n",
    "foo: error: -n option requires an argument\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`optparse`-generated error messages take care always to mention the\n",
    "option involved in the error; be sure to do the same when calling\n",
    "`OptionParser.error` from your application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `optparse`'s default error-handling behaviour does not suit your\n",

    "`~OptionParser.exit` and/or `~OptionParser.error` methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "The OptionParser constructor has no required arguments, but a number of\n",

    "that keyword argument). To suppress a usage message, pass the special\n",
    "value `optparse.SUPPRESS_USAGE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`option_list` (default: `[]`)  \n",
    "A list of Option objects to populate the parser with. The options in\n",
    "`option_list` are added after any options in `standard_option_list` (a\n",
    "class attribute that may be set by OptionParser subclasses), but before\n",
    "any version or help options. Deprecated; use `add_option` after creating\n",
    "the parser instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "`option_class` (default: optparse.Option)  \n",
    "Class to use when adding options to the parser in `add_option`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`version` (default: `None`)  \n",
    "A version string to print when the user supplies a version option. If\n",
    "you supply a true value for `version`, `optparse` automatically adds a\n",

    "\n",
    "`description` (default: `None`)  \n",
    "A paragraph of text giving a brief overview of your program. `optparse`\n",

    "### Populating the parser\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to populate the parser with options. The\n",
    "preferred way is by using `OptionParser.add_option`, as shown in section\n",
    "`optparse-tutorial`. `add_option` can be called in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   pass it an Option instance (as returned by `make_option`)\n",
    "-   pass it any combination of positional and keyword arguments that are\n",
    "    acceptable to `make_option` (i.e., to the Option constructor), and\n",
    "    it will create the Option instance for you\n",
    "\n",
    "The other alternative is to pass a list of pre-constructed Option\n",
    "instances to the OptionParser constructor, as in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    option_list = [\n",
    "        make_option(\"-f\", \"--filename\",\n",

    "        ]\n",
    "    parser = OptionParser(option_list=option_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "(`make_option` is a factory function for creating Option instances;\n",

    "pick the right class to instantiate. Do not instantiate Option\n",
    "directly.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining options\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Option instance represents a set of synonymous command-line option\n",
    "strings, e.g. `-f` and `--file`. You can specify any number of short or\n",
    "long option strings, but you must specify at least one overall option\n",
    "string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical way to create an `Option` instance is with the\n",
    "`add_option` method of `OptionParser`.\n",
    "\n",
    "OptionParser.add_option(option) OptionParser.add_option(\\*opt_str,\n",
    "attr=value, ...)\n",

    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-f\", attr=value, ...)\n",

    "And to define an option with only a long option string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"--foo\", attr=value, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword arguments define attributes of the new Option object. The\n",
    "most important option attribute is `~Option.action`, and it largely\n",
    "determines which other attributes are relevant or required. If you pass\n",
    "irrelevant option attributes, or fail to pass required ones, `optparse`\n",
    "raises an `OptionError` exception explaining your mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "An option's *action* determines what `optparse` does when it encounters\n",
    "this option on the command-line. The standard option actions hard-coded\n",
    "into `optparse` are:\n",

    "\n",
    "-   if the number starts with `0x`, it is parsed as a hexadecimal number\n",
    "-   if the number starts with `0`, it is parsed as an octal number\n",

    "supply `values`, it will be modified with repeated `setattr` calls\n",
    "(roughly one for every option argument stored to an option destination)\n",
    "and returned by `parse_args`.\n",

    "\n",
    "    parser = OptionParser(..., conflict_handler=handler)\n",
    "\n",
    "or with a separate call:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.set_conflict_handler(handler)\n",

    "\n",
    "OptionParser instances have several cyclic references. This should not\n",

    "## Option Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "When `optparse`'s built-in actions and types aren't quite enough for\n",
    "your needs, you have two choices: extend `optparse` or define a callback\n",
    "option. Extending `optparse` is more general, but overkill for a lot of\n",
    "simple cases. Quite often a simple callback is all you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two steps to defining a callback option:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   define the option itself using the `\"callback\"` action\n",
    "-   write the callback; this is a function (or method) that takes at\n",
    "    least four arguments, as described below\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a callback option\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, the easiest way to define a callback option is by using the\n",
    "`OptionParser.add_option` method. Apart from `~Option.action`, the only\n",
    "option attribute you must specify is `callback`, the function to call:\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-c\", action=\"callback\", callback=my_callback)\n",
    "\n",
    "`callback` is a function (or other callable object), so you must have\n",
    "already defined `my_callback()` when you create this callback option. In\n",
    "this simple case, `optparse` doesn't even know if `-c` takes any\n",
    "arguments, which usually means that the option takes no arguments---the\n",
    "mere presence of `-c` on the command-line is all it needs to know. In\n",
    "some circumstances, though, you might want your callback to consume an\n",
    "arbitrary number of command-line arguments. This is where writing\n",
    "callbacks gets tricky; it's covered later in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "`optparse` always passes four particular arguments to your callback, and\n",
    "it will only pass additional arguments if you specify them via\n",
    "`~Option.callback_args` and `~Option.callback_kwargs`. Thus, the minimal\n",
    "callback function signature is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_callback(option, opt, value, parser):\n",
    "\n",
    "The four arguments to a callback are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other option attributes that you can supply when you\n",
    "define a callback option:\n",
    "\n",
    "`~Option.type`  \n",
    "has its usual meaning: as with the `\"store\"` or `\"append\"` actions, it\n",
    "instructs `optparse` to consume one argument and convert it to\n",
    "`~Option.type`. Rather than storing the converted value(s) anywhere,\n",
    "though, `optparse` passes it to your callback function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`~Option.nargs`  \n",
    "also has its usual meaning: if it is supplied and \\> 1, `optparse` will\n",
    "consume `~Option.nargs` arguments, each of which must be convertible to\n",
    "`~Option.type`. It then passes a tuple of converted values to your\n",
    "callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "`~Option.callback_args`  \n",
    "a tuple of extra positional arguments to pass to the callback\n",
    "\n",
    "`~Option.callback_kwargs`  \n",
    "a dictionary of extra keyword arguments to pass to the callback\n",
    "\n",
    "### How callbacks are called\n",
    "\n",
    "All callbacks are called as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    func(option, opt_str, value, parser, *args, **kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "`option`  \n",
    "is the Option instance that's calling the callback\n",
    "\n",
    "`opt_str`  \n",
    "is the option string seen on the command-line that's triggering the\n",
    "callback. (If an abbreviated long option was used, `opt_str` will be the\n",
    "full, canonical option string---e.g. if the user puts `--foo` on the\n",
    "command-line as an abbreviation for `--foobar`, then `opt_str` will be\n",
    "`\"--foobar\"`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`value`  \n",
    "is the argument to this option seen on the command-line. `optparse` will\n",
    "only expect an argument if `~Option.type` is set; the type of `value`\n",
    "will be the type implied by the option's type. If `~Option.type` for\n",
    "this option is `None` (no argument expected), then `value` will be\n",
    "`None`. If `~Option.nargs` \\> 1, `value` will be a tuple of values of\n",
    "the appropriate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "`parser`  \n",
    "is the OptionParser instance driving the whole thing, mainly useful\n",
    "because you can access some other interesting data through its instance\n",
    "attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "`parser.largs`  \n",
    "the current list of leftover arguments, ie. arguments that have been\n",
    "consumed but are neither options nor option arguments. Feel free to\n",
    "modify `parser.largs`, e.g. by adding more arguments to it. (This list\n",
    "will become `args`, the second return value of `parse_args`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`parser.rargs`  \n",
    "the current list of remaining arguments, ie. with `opt_str` and `value`\n",
    "(if applicable) removed, and only the arguments following them still\n",
    "there. Feel free to modify `parser.rargs`, e.g. by consuming more\n",
    "arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "`parser.values`  \n",
    "the object where option values are by default stored (an instance of\n",
    "optparse.OptionValues). This lets callbacks use the same mechanism as\n",
    "the rest of `optparse` for storing option values; you don't need to mess\n",
    "around with globals or closures. You can also access or modify the\n",
    "value(s) of any options already encountered on the command-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "`args`  \n",
    "is a tuple of arbitrary positional arguments supplied via the\n",
    "`~Option.callback_args` option attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "`kwargs`  \n",
    "is a dictionary of arbitrary keyword arguments supplied via\n",
    "`~Option.callback_kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raising errors in a callback\n",
    "\n",
    "The callback function should raise `OptionValueError` if there are any\n",
    "problems with the option or its argument(s). `optparse` catches this and\n",
    "terminates the program, printing the error message you supply to stderr.\n",
    "Your message should be clear, concise, accurate, and mention the option\n",
    "at fault. Otherwise, the user will have a hard time figuring out what\n",
    "they did wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callback example 1: trivial callback\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a callback option that takes no arguments, and\n",
    "simply records that the option was seen:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def record_foo_seen(option, opt_str, value, parser):\n",
    "        parser.values.saw_foo = True\n",
    "\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"--foo\", action=\"callback\", callback=record_foo_seen)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you could do that with the `\"store_true\"` action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callback example 2: check option order\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a slightly more interesting example: record the fact that `-a` is\n",
    "seen, but blow up if it comes after `-b` in the command-line. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    def check_order(option, opt_str, value, parser):\n",
    "        if parser.values.b:\n",
    "            raise OptionValueError(\"can't use -a after -b\")\n",
    "        parser.values.a = 1\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-a\", action=\"callback\", callback=check_order)\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-b\", action=\"store_true\", dest=\"b\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callback example 3: check option order (generalized)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to re-use this callback for several similar options (set a\n",
    "flag, but blow up if `-b` has already been seen), it needs a bit of\n",
    "work: the error message and the flag that it sets must be generalized. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    def check_order(option, opt_str, value, parser):\n",
    "        if parser.values.b:\n",
    "            raise OptionValueError(\"can't use %s after -b\" % opt_str)\n",
    "        setattr(parser.values, option.dest, 1)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-a\", action=\"callback\", callback=check_order, dest='a')\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-b\", action=\"store_true\", dest=\"b\")\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"-c\", action=\"callback\", callback=check_order, dest='c')\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callback example 4: check arbitrary condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you could put any condition in there---you're not limited to\n",
    "checking the values of already-defined options. For example, if you have\n",
    "options that should not be called when the moon is full, all you have to\n",
    "do is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def check_moon(option, opt_str, value, parser):\n",
    "        if is_moon_full():\n",
    "            raise OptionValueError(\"%s option invalid when moon is full\"\n",
    "                                   % opt_str)\n",
    "        setattr(parser.values, option.dest, 1)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"--foo\",\n",
    "                      action=\"callback\", callback=check_moon, dest=\"foo\")\n",
    "\n",
    "(The definition of `is_moon_full()` is left as an exercise for the\n",
    "reader.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callback example 5: fixed arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Things get slightly more interesting when you define callback options\n",
    "that take a fixed number of arguments. Specifying that a callback option\n",
    "takes arguments is similar to defining a `\"store\"` or `\"append\"` option:\n",
    "if you define `~Option.type`, then the option takes one argument that\n",
    "must be convertible to that type; if you further define `~Option.nargs`,\n",
    "then the option takes `~Option.nargs` arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that just emulates the standard `\"store\"` action:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def store_value(option, opt_str, value, parser):\n",
    "        setattr(parser.values, option.dest, value)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    parser.add_option(\"--foo\",\n",
    "                      action=\"callback\", callback=store_value,\n",
    "                      type=\"int\", nargs=3, dest=\"foo\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `optparse` takes care of consuming 3 arguments and converting\n",
    "them to integers for you; all you have to do is store them. (Or\n",
    "whatever; obviously you don't need a callback for this example.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callback example 6: variable arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Things get hairy when you want an option to take a variable number of\n",
    "arguments. For this case, you must write a callback, as `optparse`\n",
    "doesn't provide any built-in capabilities for it. And you have to deal\n",
    "with certain intricacies of conventional Unix command-line parsing that\n",
    "`optparse` normally handles for you. In particular, callbacks should\n",
    "implement the conventional rules for bare `--` and `-` arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   either `--` or `-` can be option arguments\n",
    "-   bare `--` (if not the argument to some option): halt command-line\n",
    "    processing and discard the `--`\n",
    "-   bare `-` (if not the argument to some option): halt command-line\n",
    "    processing but keep the `-` (append it to `parser.largs`)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want an option that takes a variable number of arguments, there\n",
    "are several subtle, tricky issues to worry about. The exact\n",
    "implementation you choose will be based on which trade-offs you're\n",
    "willing to make for your application (which is why `optparse` doesn't\n",
    "support this sort of thing directly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, here's a stab at a callback for an option with variable\n",
    "arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def vararg_callback(option, opt_str, value, parser):\n",
    "        assert value is None\n",
    "        value = []\n",
    "\n",
    "        def floatable(str):\n",

    "                return True\n",
    "            except ValueError:\n",
    "                return False\n",
    "\n",
    "        for arg in parser.rargs:\n",
    "            # stop on --foo like options\n",

    "                break\n",
    "            # stop on -a, but not on -3 or -3.0\n",

    "\n",
    "## Extending `optparse`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the two major controlling factors in how `optparse` interprets\n",
    "command-line options are the action and type of each option, the most\n",
    "likely direction of extension is to add new actions and new types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding new types\n",
    "\n",
    "To add new types, you need to define your own subclass of `optparse`'s\n",
    "`Option` class. This class has a couple of attributes that define\n",
    "`optparse`'s types: `~Option.TYPES` and `~Option.TYPE_CHECKER`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option.TYPES\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple of type names; in your subclass, simply define a new tuple\n",
    "`TYPES` that builds on the standard one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option.TYPE_CHECKER\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary mapping type names to type-checking functions. A\n",
    "type-checking function has the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def check_mytype(option, opt, value)\n",
    "\n",
    "where `option` is an `Option` instance, `opt` is an option string (e.g.,\n",
    "`-f`), and `value` is the string from the command line that must be\n",
    "checked and converted to your desired type. `check_mytype()` should\n",
    "return an object of the hypothetical type `mytype`. The value returned\n",
    "by a type-checking function will wind up in the OptionValues instance\n",
    "returned by `OptionParser.parse_args`, or be passed to a callback as the\n",
    "`value` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your type-checking function should raise `OptionValueError` if it\n",
    "encounters any problems. `OptionValueError` takes a single string\n",

    "which in turn prepends the program name and the string `\"error:\"` and\n",
    "prints everything to stderr before terminating the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a silly example that demonstrates adding a `\"complex\"` option\n",

    "First, the necessary imports:\n",

    "You need to define your type-checker first, since it's referred to later\n",
    "(in the `~Option.TYPE_CHECKER` class attribute of your Option subclass):\n",

    "    def check_complex(option, opt, value):\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            return complex(value)\n",

    "class. This being Python, nothing stops you from doing that except good\n",
    "manners and common sense.)\n",
    "\n",

    "### Adding new actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding new actions is a bit trickier, because you have to understand\n",
    "that `optparse` has a couple of classifications for actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"store\" actions  \n",
    "actions that result in `optparse` storing a value to an attribute of the\n",
    "current OptionValues instance; these options require a `~Option.dest`\n",
    "attribute to be supplied to the Option constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"typed\" actions  \n",
    "actions that take a value from the command line and expect it to be of a\n",
    "certain type; or rather, a string that can be converted to a certain\n",
    "type. These options require a `~Option.type` attribute to the Option\n",
    "constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are overlapping sets: some default \"store\" actions are `\"store\"`,\n",
    "`\"store_const\"`, `\"append\"`, and `\"count\"`, while the default \"typed\"\n",
    "actions are `\"store\"`, `\"append\"`, and `\"callback\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add an action, you need to categorize it by listing it in at\n",
    "least one of the following class attributes of Option (all are lists of\n",
    "strings):\n",
    "\n",
    "Option.ACTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "All actions must be listed in ACTIONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option.STORE_ACTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "\"store\" actions are additionally listed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option.TYPED_ACTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "\"typed\" actions are additionally listed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option.ALWAYS_TYPED_ACTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions that always take a type (i.e. whose options always take a value)\n",
    "are additionally listed here. The only effect of this is that `optparse`\n",
    "assigns the default type, `\"string\"`, to options with no explicit type\n",
    "whose action is listed in `ALWAYS_TYPED_ACTIONS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to actually implement your new action, you must override\n",
    "Option's `take_action` method and add a case that recognizes your\n",
    "action.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's add an `\"extend\"` action. This is similar to the\n",
    "standard `\"append\"` action, but instead of taking a single value from\n",
    "the command-line and appending it to an existing list, `\"extend\"` will\n",
    "take multiple values in a single comma-delimited string, and extend an\n",
    "existing list with them. That is, if `--names` is an `\"extend\"` option\n",
    "of type `\"string\"`, the command line :\n",
    "\n",
    "    --names=foo,bar --names blah --names ding,dong\n",
    "\n",
    "would result in a list :\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"blah\", \"ding\", \"dong\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we define a subclass of Option:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyOption(Option):\n",
    "\n",
    "        ACTIONS = Option.ACTIONS + (\"extend\",)\n",
    "        STORE_ACTIONS = Option.STORE_ACTIONS + (\"extend\",)\n",
    "        TYPED_ACTIONS = Option.TYPED_ACTIONS + (\"extend\",)\n",
    "        ALWAYS_TYPED_ACTIONS = Option.ALWAYS_TYPED_ACTIONS + (\"extend\",)\n",
    "\n",
    "        def take_action(self, action, dest, opt, value, values, parser):\n",
    "            if action == \"extend\":\n",
    "                lvalue = value.split(\",\")\n",
    "                values.ensure_value(dest, []).extend(lvalue)\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                Option.take_action(\n",
    "                    self, action, dest, opt, value, values, parser)\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of note:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `\"extend\"` both expects a value on the command-line and stores that\n",
    "    value somewhere, so it goes in both `~Option.STORE_ACTIONS` and\n",
    "    `~Option.TYPED_ACTIONS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   to ensure that `optparse` assigns the default type of `\"string\"` to\n",
    "    `\"extend\"` actions, we put the `\"extend\"` action in\n",
    "    `~Option.ALWAYS_TYPED_ACTIONS` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `MyOption.take_action` implements just this one new action, and\n",
    "    passes control back to `Option.take_action` for the standard\n",
    "    `optparse` actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `values` is an instance of the optparse_parser.Values class, which\n",
    "    provides the very useful `ensure_value` method. `ensure_value` is\n",
    "    essentially `getattr` with a safety valve; it is called as :\n",
    "\n",
    "        values.ensure_value(attr, value)\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the `attr` attribute of `values` doesn't exist or is `None`, then\n",
    "    ensure_value() first sets it to `value`, and then returns 'value.\n",
    "    This is very handy for actions like `\"extend\"`, `\"append\"`, and\n",
    "    `\"count\"`, all of which accumulate data in a variable and expect\n",
    "    that variable to be of a certain type (a list for the first two, an\n",
    "    integer for the latter). Using `ensure_value` means that scripts\n",
    "    using your action don't have to worry about setting a default value\n",
    "    for the option destinations in question; they can just leave the\n",
    "    default as `None` and `ensure_value` will take care of getting it\n",
    "    right when it's needed."
