    "# `posix` --- The most common POSIX system calls\n",

    "\n",
    "This module provides access to operating system functionality that is\n",
    "standardized by the C Standard and the POSIX standard (a thinly\n",
    "disguised Unix interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "module: os\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not import this module directly.** Instead, import the module `os`,\n",
    "which provides a *portable* version of this interface. On Unix, the `os`\n",
    "module provides a superset of the `posix` interface. On non-Unix\n",
    "operating systems the `posix` module is not available, but a subset is\n",
    "always available through the `os` interface. Once `os` is imported,\n",
    "there is *no* performance penalty in using it instead of `posix`. In\n",
    "addition, `os` provides some additional functionality, such as\n",
    "automatically calling `~os.putenv` when an entry in `os.environ` is\n",

    "Steve Clift \\<<clift@mail.anacapa.net>\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "Several operating systems (including AIX, HP-UX and Solaris) provide\n",
    "support for files that are larger than 2 GiB from a C programming model\n",
    "where :c`int` and :c`long` are 32-bit values. This is typically\n",
    "accomplished by defining the relevant size and offset types as 64-bit\n",
    "values. Such files are sometimes referred to as `large files`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large file support is enabled in Python when the size of an :c`off_t` is\n",
    "larger than a :c`long` and the :c`long long` is at least as large as an\n",
    ":c`off_t`. It may be necessary to configure and compile Python with\n",
    "certain compiler flags to enable this mode. For example, with Solaris\n",

    "## Notable Module Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to many functions described in the `os` module\n",
    "documentation, `posix` defines the following data item:\n",
    "\n",
    "environ\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary representing the string environment at the time the\n",
    "interpreter was started. Keys and values are bytes on Unix and str on\n",
    "Windows. For example, `environ[b'HOME']` (`environ['HOME']` on Windows)\n",
    "is the pathname of your home directory, equivalent to `getenv(\"HOME\")`\n",
    "in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying this dictionary does not affect the string environment passed\n",
    "on by `~os.execv`, `~os.popen` or `~os.system`; if you need to change\n",
    "the environment, pass `environ` to `~os.execve` or add variable\n",
    "assignments and export statements to the command string for `~os.system`\n",
    "or `~os.popen`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 On Unix, keys and values are bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The `os` module provides an alternate implementation of `environ` which\n",
    "updates the environment on modification. Note also that updating\n",
    "`os.environ` will render this dictionary obsolete. Use of the `os`\n",
    "module version of this is recommended over direct access to the `posix`\n",
    "module."
