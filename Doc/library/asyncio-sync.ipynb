    "# Synchronization Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source code:** `Lib/asyncio/locks.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio synchronization primitives are designed to be similar to those\n",
    "of the `threading` module with two important caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   asyncio primitives are not thread-safe, therefore they should not be\n",
    "    used for OS thread synchronization (use `threading` for that);\n",
    "-   methods of these synchronization primitives do not accept the\n",
    "    *timeout* argument; use the `asyncio.wait_for` function to perform\n",
    "    operations with timeouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio has the following basic synchronization primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Lock`\n",
    "-   `Event`\n",
    "-   `Condition`\n",
    "-   `Semaphore`\n",
    "-   `BoundedSemaphore`\n",
    "-   `Barrier`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lock\n",
    "\n",
    "Implements a mutex lock for asyncio tasks. Not thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "An asyncio lock can be used to guarantee exclusive access to a shared\n",
    "resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred way to use a Lock is an `async with` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    lock = asyncio.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ... later\n",
    "    async with lock:\n",
    "        # access shared state\n",
    "\n",
    "which is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    lock = asyncio.Lock()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ... later\n",
    "    await lock.acquire()\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # access shared state\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        lock.release()\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 Removed the *loop* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "acquire()\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquire the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method waits until the lock is *unlocked*, sets it to *locked* and\n",
    "returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When more than one coroutine is blocked in `acquire` waiting for the\n",
    "lock to be unlocked, only one coroutine eventually proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquiring a lock is *fair*: the coroutine that proceeds will be the\n",
    "first coroutine that started waiting on the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "release()\n",
    "\n",
    "Release the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the lock is *locked*, reset it to *unlocked* and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the lock is *unlocked*, a `RuntimeError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "locked()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `True` if the lock is *locked*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Event\n",
    "\n",
    "An event object. Not thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "An asyncio event can be used to notify multiple asyncio tasks that some\n",
    "event has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Event object manages an internal flag that can be set to *true* with\n",
    "the `~Event.set` method and reset to *false* with the `clear` method.\n",
    "The `~Event.wait` method blocks until the flag is set to *true*. The\n",
    "flag is set to *false* initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 Removed the *loop* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    async def waiter(event):\n",
    "        print('waiting for it ...')\n",
    "        await event.wait()\n",
    "        print('... got it!')\n",
    "\n",
    "    async def main():\n",
    "        # Create an Event object.\n",
    "        event = asyncio.Event()\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Spawn a Task to wait until 'event' is set.\n",
    "        waiter_task = asyncio.create_task(waiter(event))\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Sleep for 1 second and set the event.\n",
    "        await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "        event.set()\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Wait until the waiter task is finished.\n",
    "        await waiter_task\n",
    "\n",
    "    asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "\n",
    "wait()\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait until the event is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the event is set, return `True` immediately. Otherwise block until\n",
    "another task calls `~Event.set`.\n",
    "\n",
    "set()\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "All tasks waiting for event to be set will be immediately awakened.\n",
    "\n",
    "clear()\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear (unset) the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks awaiting on `~Event.wait` will now block until the `~Event.set`\n",
    "method is called again.\n",
    "\n",
    "is_set()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `True` if the event is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "A Condition object. Not thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "An asyncio condition primitive can be used by a task to wait for some\n",
    "event to happen and then get exclusive access to a shared resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a Condition object combines the functionality of an `Event`\n",
    "and a `Lock`. It is possible to have multiple Condition objects share\n",
    "one Lock, which allows coordinating exclusive access to a shared\n",
    "resource between different tasks interested in particular states of that\n",
    "shared resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional *lock* argument must be a `Lock` object or `None`. In the\n",
    "latter case a new Lock object is created automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 Removed the *loop* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred way to use a Condition is an `async with` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cond = asyncio.Condition()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ... later\n",
    "    async with cond:\n",
    "        await cond.wait()\n",
    "\n",
    "which is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cond = asyncio.Condition()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ... later\n",
    "    await cond.acquire()\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        await cond.wait()\n",

    "\n",
    "acquire()\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquire the underlying lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method waits until the underlying lock is *unlocked*, sets it to\n",
    "*locked* and returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "notify(n=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wake up at most *n* tasks (1 by default) waiting on this condition. The\n",
    "method is no-op if no tasks are waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lock must be acquired before this method is called and released\n",

    "notify_all()\n",
    "\n",
    "Wake up all tasks waiting on this condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method acts like `notify`, but wakes up all waiting tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lock must be acquired before this method is called and released\n",
    "shortly after. If called with an *unlocked* lock a `RuntimeError` error\n",

    "wait()\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait until notified.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the calling task has not acquired the lock when this method is\n",
    "called, a `RuntimeError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until it is\n",
    "awakened by a `notify` or `notify_all` call. Once awakened, the\n",
    "Condition re-acquires its lock and this method returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "wait_for(predicate)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait until a predicate becomes *true*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicate must be a callable which result will be interpreted as a\n",
    "boolean value. The final value is the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "A Semaphore object. Not thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each\n",
    "`acquire` call and incremented by each `release` call. The counter can\n",
    "never go below zero; when `acquire` finds that it is zero, it blocks,\n",
    "waiting until some task calls `release`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional *value* argument gives the initial value for the internal\n",
    "counter (`1` by default). If the given value is less than `0` a\n",
    "`ValueError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 Removed the *loop* parameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "Acquire a semaphore.\n",

    "\n",
    "Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one. Can wake\n",
    "up a task waiting to acquire the semaphore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `BoundedSemaphore`, `Semaphore` allows making more `release()`\n",
    "calls than `acquire()` calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BoundedSemaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "A bounded semaphore object. Not thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounded Semaphore is a version of `Semaphore` that raises a `ValueError`\n",
    "in `~Semaphore.release` if it increases the internal counter above the\n",

    "3.10 Removed the *loop* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Barrier\n",
    "\n",
    "A barrier object. Not thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "A barrier is a simple synchronization primitive that allows to block\n",
    "until *parties* number of tasks are waiting on it. Tasks can wait on the\n",
    "`~Barrier.wait` method and would be blocked until the specified number\n",
    "of tasks end up waiting on `~Barrier.wait`. At that point all of the\n",
    "waiting tasks would unblock simultaneously.\n",

    "\n",
    "The return value is an integer in the range of 0 to `parties-1`,\n",
