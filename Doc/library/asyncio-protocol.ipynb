    "# Transports and Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preface**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transports and Protocols are used by the **low-level** event loop APIs\n",
    "such as `loop.create_connection`. They use callback-based programming\n",
    "style and enable high-performance implementations of network or IPC\n",
    "protocols (e.g. HTTP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, transports and protocols should only be used in libraries\n",
    "and frameworks and never in high-level asyncio applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation page covers both [Transports](#transports) and\n",
    "[Protocols](#protocols).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the highest level, the transport is concerned with *how* bytes are\n",
    "transmitted, while the protocol determines *which* bytes to transmit\n",
    "(and to some extent when).\n",
    "\n",
    "A different way of saying the same thing: a transport is an abstraction\n",
    "for a socket (or similar I/O endpoint) while a protocol is an\n",
    "abstraction for an application, from the transport's point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another view is the transport and protocol interfaces together\n",
    "define an abstract interface for using network I/O and interprocess I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always a 1:1 relationship between transport and protocol\n",
    "objects: the protocol calls transport methods to send data, while the\n",
    "transport calls protocol methods to pass it data that has been received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of connection oriented event loop methods (such as\n",
    "`loop.create_connection`) usually accept a *protocol_factory* argument\n",
    "used to create a *Protocol* object for an accepted connection,\n",
    "represented by a *Transport* object. Such methods usually return a tuple\n",
    "of `(transport, protocol)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contents**\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation page contains the following sections:\n",

    "-   The [Transports](#transports) section documents asyncio\n",

    "with `transports <asyncio-transport>`.\n",
    "\n",

    "on certain events, for example when some data is received. A base\n",

    "\n",
    "The argument is either an exception object or `None`. The latter means a\n",

    "This method may return a false value (including `None`), in which case\n",
