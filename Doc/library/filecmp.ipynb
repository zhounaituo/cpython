    "The `filecmp` module defines functions to compare files and directories,\n",
    "with various optional time/correctness trade-offs. For comparing files,\n",
    "see also the `difflib` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filecmp` module defines the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "cmp(f1, f2, shallow=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the files named *f1* and *f2*, returning `True` if they seem\n",
    "equal, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *shallow* is true and the `os.stat` signatures (file type, size, and\n",
    "modification time) of both files are identical, the files are taken to\n",
    "be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the files are treated as different if their sizes or contents\n",
    "differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that no external programs are called from this function, giving it\n",
    "portability and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function uses a cache for past comparisons and the results, with\n",
    "cache entries invalidated if the `os.stat` information for the file\n",
    "changes. The entire cache may be cleared using `clear_cache`.\n",
    "\n",
    "cmpfiles(dir1, dir2, common, shallow=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the files in the two directories *dir1* and *dir2* whose names\n",
    "are given by *common*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns three lists of file names: *match*, *mismatch*, *errors*.\n",
    "*match* contains the list of files that match, *mismatch* contains the\n",
    "names of those that don't, and *errors* lists the names of files which\n",
    "could not be compared. Files are listed in *errors* if they don't exist\n",
    "in one of the directories, the user lacks permission to read them or if\n",
    "the comparison could not be done for some other reason.\n",

    "`filecmp.cmp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `cmpfiles('a', 'b', ['c', 'd/e'])` will compare `a/c` with\n",
