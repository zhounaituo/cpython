    "3.6 3.12 The `asyncore` module is deprecated (see\n",
    "`PEP 594 <594#asyncore>` for details). Please use `asyncio` instead.\n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This module exists for backwards compatibility only. For new code we\n",
    "recommend using `asyncio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module provides the basic infrastructure for writing asynchronous\n",
    "socket service clients and servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two ways to have a program on a single processor do \"more\n",
    "than one thing at a time.\" Multi-threaded programming is the simplest\n",
    "and most popular way to do it, but there is another very different\n",
    "technique, that lets you have nearly all the advantages of\n",
    "multi-threading, without actually using multiple threads. It's really\n",
    "only practical if your program is largely I/O bound. If your program is\n",
    "processor bound, then pre-emptive scheduled threads are probably what\n",
    "you really need. Network servers are rarely processor bound, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your operating system supports the :c`select` system call in its I/O\n",
    "library (and nearly all do), then you can use it to juggle multiple\n",
    "communication channels at once; doing other work while your I/O is\n",
    "taking place in the \"background.\" Although this strategy can seem\n",
    "strange and complex, especially at first, it is in many ways easier to\n",
    "understand and control than multi-threaded programming. The `asyncore`\n",
    "module solves many of the difficult problems for you, making the task of\n",
    "building sophisticated high-performance network servers and clients a\n",
    "snap. For \"conversational\" applications and protocols the companion\n",
    "`asynchat` module is invaluable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind both modules is to create one or more network\n",
    "*channels*, instances of class `asyncore.dispatcher` and\n",
    "`asynchat.async_chat`. Creating the channels adds them to a global map,\n",
    "used by the `loop` function if you do not provide it with your own\n",
    "*map*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the initial channel(s) is(are) created, calling the `loop` function\n",
    "activates channel service, which continues until the last channel\n",
    "(including any that have been added to the map during asynchronous\n",
    "service) is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "loop(\\[timeout\\[, use_poll\\[, map\\[,count\\]\\]\\]\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter a polling loop that terminates after count passes or all open\n",
    "channels have been closed. All arguments are optional. The *count*\n",
    "parameter defaults to `None`, resulting in the loop terminating only\n",
    "when all channels have been closed. The *timeout* argument sets the\n",
    "timeout parameter for the appropriate `~select.select` or `~select.poll`\n",
    "call, measured in seconds; the default is 30 seconds. The *use_poll*\n",
    "parameter, if true, indicates that `~select.poll` should be used in\n",
    "preference to `~select.select` (the default is `False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *map* parameter is a dictionary whose items are the channels to\n",
    "watch. As channels are closed they are deleted from their map. If *map*\n",
    "is omitted, a global map is used. Channels (instances of\n",
    "`asyncore.dispatcher`, `asynchat.async_chat` and subclasses thereof) can\n",
    "freely be mixed in the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dispatcher` class is a thin wrapper around a low-level socket\n",
    "object. To make it more useful, it has a few methods for event-handling\n",
    "which are called from the asynchronous loop. Otherwise, it can be\n",
    "treated as a normal non-blocking socket object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The firing of low-level events at certain times or in certain connection\n",
    "states tells the asynchronous loop that certain higher-level events have\n",
    "taken place. For example, if we have asked for a socket to connect to\n",
    "another host, we know that the connection has been made when the socket\n",
    "becomes writable for the first time (at this point you know that you may\n",
    "write to it with the expectation of success). The implied higher-level\n",
    "events are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Event               | Description                                    |\n",

    "| `handle_connect()`  | Implied by the first read or write event       |\n",

    "During asynchronous processing, each mapped channel's `readable` and\n",
