    "The `curses` module provides an interface to the curses library, the\n",
    "de-facto standard for portable advanced terminal handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "While curses is most widely used in the Unix environment, versions are\n",
    "available for Windows, DOS, and possibly other systems as well. This\n",
    "extension module is designed to match the API of ncurses, an open-source\n",
    "curses library hosted on Linux and the BSD variants of Unix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the documentation mentions a *character* it can be specified as\n",
    "an integer, a one-character Unicode string or a one-byte byte string.\n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `curses` defines the following exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "error\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception raised when a curses library function returns an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever *x* or *y* arguments to a function or a method are optional,\n",
    "they default to the current cursor location. Whenever *attr* is\n",
    "optional, it defaults to `A_NORMAL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `curses` defines the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "baudrate()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the output speed of the terminal in bits per second. On software\n",
    "terminal emulators it will have a fixed high value. Included for\n",
    "historical reasons; in former times, it was used to write output loops\n",
    "for time delays and occasionally to change interfaces depending on the\n",
    "line speed.\n",

    "\n",
    "Emit a short attention sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "can_change_color()\n",

    "the colors displayed by the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "cbreak()\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter cbreak mode. In cbreak mode (sometimes called \"rare\" mode) normal\n",
    "tty line buffering is turned off and characters are available to be read\n",
    "one by one. However, unlike raw mode, special characters (interrupt,\n",
    "quit, suspend, and flow control) retain their effects on the tty driver\n",
    "and calling program. Calling first `raw` then `cbreak` leaves the\n",
    "terminal in cbreak mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "color_content(color_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the intensity of the red, green, and blue (RGB) components in the\n",
    "color *color_number*, which must be between `0` and `COLORS - 1`. Return\n",
    "a 3-tuple, containing the R,G,B values for the given color, which will\n",

    "\n",
    "color_pair(pair_number)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the attribute value for displaying text in the specified color\n",
    "pair. Only the first 256 color pairs are supported. This attribute value\n",
    "can be combined with `A_STANDOUT`, `A_REVERSE`, and the other `A_\\*`\n",
    "attributes. `pair_number` is the counterpart to this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "curs_set(visibility)\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the cursor state. *visibility* can be set to `0`, `1`, or `2`, for\n",
    "invisible, normal, or very visible. If the terminal supports the\n",
    "visibility requested, return the previous cursor state; otherwise raise\n",
    "an exception. On many terminals, the \"visible\" mode is an underline\n",
    "cursor and the \"very visible\" mode is a block cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "def_prog_mode()\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the current terminal mode as the \"program\" mode, the mode when the\n",
    "running program is using curses. (Its counterpart is the \"shell\" mode,\n",
    "for when the program is not in curses.) Subsequent calls to\n",
    "`reset_prog_mode` will restore this mode.\n",

    "def_shell_mode()\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the current terminal mode as the \"shell\" mode, the mode when the\n",

    "The virtual screen may be updated by a `~window.noutrefresh` call after\n",
    "write operations such as `~window.addstr` have been performed on a\n",
    "window. The normal `~window.refresh` call is simply `!noutrefresh`\n",

    "the capabilities `clear`, `cup`, `cud`, `cud1`, `cuu1`, `cuu`, `vpa` are\n",
    "disabled; and the `home` string is set to the value of `cr`. The effect\n",
    "is that the cursor is confined to the current line, and so are screen\n",
    "updates. This may be used for enabling character-at-a-time line editing\n",
    "without touching the rest of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "flash()\n",
    "\n",
    "Flash the screen. That is, change it to reverse-video and then change it\n",
