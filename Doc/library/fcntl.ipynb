    "This module performs file control and I/O control on file descriptors.\n",
    "It is an interface to the :c`fcntl` and :c`ioctl` Unix routines. For a\n",
    "complete description of these calls, see `fcntl(2)` and `ioctl(2)` Unix\n",
    "manual pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first\n",
    "argument. This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by\n",
    "`sys.stdin.fileno()`, or an `io.IOBase` object, such as `sys.stdin`\n",
    "itself, which provides a `~io.IOBase.fileno` that returns a genuine file\n",
    "descriptor.\n",

    "3.3 Operations in this module used to raise an `IOError` where they now\n",
    "raise an `OSError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.8 The fcntl module now contains `F_ADD_SEALS`, `F_GET_SEALS`, and\n",
    "`F_SEAL_*` constants for sealing of `os.memfd_create` file descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.9 On macOS, the fcntl module exposes the `F_GETPATH` constant, which\n",
    "obtains the path of a file from a file descriptor. On Linux(\\>=3.15),\n",
    "the fcntl module exposes the `F_OFD_GETLK`, `F_OFD_SETLK` and\n",
    "`F_OFD_SETLKW` constants, which are used when working with open file\n",
    "description locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 On Linux \\>= 2.6.11, the fcntl module exposes the `F_GETPIPE_SZ`\n",
    "and `F_SETPIPE_SZ` constants, which allow to check and modify a pipe's\n",
    "size respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.11 On FreeBSD, the fcntl module exposes the `F_DUP2FD` and\n",
    "`F_DUP2FD_CLOEXEC` constants, which allow to duplicate a file\n",
    "descriptor, the latter setting `FD_CLOEXEC` flag in addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module defines the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "fcntl(fd, cmd, arg=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the operation *cmd* on file descriptor *fd* (file objects\n",
    "providing a `~io.IOBase.fileno` method are accepted as well). The values\n",
    "used for *cmd* are operating system dependent, and are available as\n",
    "constants in the `fcntl` module, using the same names as used in the\n",
    "relevant C header files. The argument *arg* can either be an integer\n",
    "value, or a `bytes` object. With an integer value, the return value of\n",
    "this function is the integer return value of the C :c`fcntl` call. When\n",
    "the argument is bytes it represents a binary structure, e.g. created by\n",
    "`struct.pack`. The binary data is copied to a buffer whose address is\n",
    "passed to the C :c`fcntl` call. The return value after a successful call\n",
    "is the contents of the buffer, converted to a `bytes` object. The length\n",
    "of the returned object will be the same as the length of the *arg*\n",
    "argument. This is limited to 1024 bytes. If the information returned in\n",
    "the buffer by the operating system is larger than 1024 bytes, this is\n",
    "most likely to result in a segmentation violation or a more subtle data\n",
    "corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the :c`fcntl` fails, an `OSError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "fcntl.fcntl fd,cmd,arg fcntl.fcntl\n",
    "\n",
    "ioctl(fd, request, arg=0, mutate_flag=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is identical to the `~fcntl.fcntl` function, except that\n",
    "the argument handling is even more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *request* parameter is limited to values that can fit in 32-bits.\n",
    "Additional constants of interest for use as the *request* argument can\n",
    "be found in the `termios` module, under the same names as used in the\n",
    "relevant C header files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter *arg* can be one of an integer, an object supporting the\n",
    "read-only buffer interface (like `bytes`) or an object supporting the\n",
    "read-write buffer interface (like `bytearray`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In all but the last case, behaviour is as for the `~fcntl.fcntl`\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a mutable buffer is passed, then the behaviour is determined by the\n",
    "value of the *mutate_flag* parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is false, the buffer's mutability is ignored and behaviour is as\n",
    "for a read-only buffer, except that the 1024 byte limit mentioned above\n",
    "is avoided --so long as the buffer you pass is at least as long as what\n",
    "the operating system wants to put there, things should work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *mutate_flag* is true (the default), then the buffer is (in effect)\n",
    "passed to the underlying `ioctl` system call, the latter's return code\n",
    "is passed back to the calling Python, and the buffer's new contents\n",
    "reflect the action of the `ioctl`. This is a slight simplification,\n",
    "because if the supplied buffer is less than 1024 bytes long it is first\n",
    "copied into a static buffer 1024 bytes long which is then passed to\n",
