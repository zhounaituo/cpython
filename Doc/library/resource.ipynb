    "This module provides basic mechanisms for measuring and controlling\n",
    "system resources utilized by a program.\n",

    "## Resource Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources usage can be limited using the `setrlimit` function described\n",
    "below. Each resource is controlled by a pair of limits: a soft limit and\n",
    "a hard limit. The soft limit is the current limit, and may be lowered or\n",
    "raised by a process over time. The soft limit can never exceed the hard\n",
    "limit. The hard limit can be lowered to any value greater than the soft\n",
    "limit, but not raised. (Only processes with the effective UID of the\n",
    "super-user can raise a hard limit.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific resources that can be limited are system dependent. They\n",
    "are described in the `getrlimit(2)` man page. The resources listed below\n",

    "limit. Specifying a limit of `~resource.RLIM_INFINITY` when the hard or\n",
    "system limit for that resource is not unlimited will result in a\n",
    "`ValueError`. A process with the effective UID of super-user can request\n",
