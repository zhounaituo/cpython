    "-   The exactness carries over into arithmetic. In decimal floating\n",
    "    point, `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3` is exactly equal to zero. In binary\n",
    "    floating point, the result is `5.5511151231257827e-017`. While near\n",

    "    significance. This is the customary presentation for monetary\n",

    "\n",
    "If the context's trap enabler is set for the signal, then the condition\n",

    "\n",
    "Some operations are indeterminate and return `NaN`, or if the\n",

    "`0/0` returns `NaN` which means \"not a number\". This variety of `NaN` is\n",
    "quiet and, once created, will flow through other computations always\n",
