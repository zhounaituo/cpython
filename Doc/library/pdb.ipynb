    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `pdb` defines an interactive source code debugger for Python\n",
    "programs. It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single\n",
    "stepping at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source\n",
    "code listing, and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of\n",
    "any stack frame. It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be\n",
    "called under program control.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: Pdb (class in pdb) module: bdb module: cmd\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugger is extensible -- it is actually defined as the class `Pdb`.\n",
    "This is currently undocumented but easily understood by reading the\n",
    "source. The extension interface uses the modules `bdb` and `cmd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugger's prompt is `(Pdb)`. Typical usage to run a program under\n",
    "control of the debugger is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import pdb\n",
    "    >>> import mymodule\n",
    "    >>> pdb.run('mymodule.test()')\n",
    "    > <string>(0)?()\n",
    "    (Pdb) continue\n",
    "    > <string>(1)?()\n",
    "    (Pdb) continue\n",
    "    NameError: 'spam'\n",
    "    > <string>(1)?()\n",
    "    (Pdb)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Tab-completion via the `readline` module is available for commands\n",
    "and command arguments, e.g. the current global and local names are\n",
    "offered as arguments of the `p` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pdb.py` can also be invoked as a script to debug other scripts. For\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m pdb myscript.py\n",
    "\n",
    "When invoked as a script, pdb will automatically enter post-mortem\n",
    "debugging if the program being debugged exits abnormally. After\n",
    "post-mortem debugging (or after normal exit of the program), pdb will\n",
    "restart the program. Automatic restarting preserves pdb's state (such as\n",
    "breakpoints) and in most cases is more useful than quitting the debugger\n",
    "upon program's exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 `pdb.py` now accepts a `-c` option that executes commands as if\n",
    "given in a `.pdbrc` file, see `debugger-commands`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 `pdb.py` now accepts a `-m` option that execute modules similar to\n",
    "the way `python3 -m` does. As with a script, the debugger will pause\n",
    "execution just before the first line of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical usage to break into the debugger is to insert:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n",
    "\n",
    "at the location you want to break into the debugger, and then run the\n",
    "program. You can then step through the code following this statement,\n",
    "and continue running without the debugger using the `continue` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 The built-in `breakpoint()`, when called with defaults, can be used\n",
    "instead of `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical usage to inspect a crashed program is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import pdb\n",
    "    >>> import mymodule\n",
    "    >>> mymodule.test()\n",
    "    Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",

    "        test2()\n",
    "      File \"./mymodule.py\", line 3, in test2\n",

    "run(statement, globals=None, locals=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the *statement* (given as a string or a code object) under\n",
    "debugger control. The debugger prompt appears before any code is\n",
    "executed; you can set breakpoints and type `continue`, or you can step\n",
    "through the statement using `step` or `next` (all these commands are\n",
    "explained below). The optional *globals* and *locals* arguments specify\n",
    "the environment in which the code is executed; by default the dictionary\n",
    "of the module `__main__` is used. (See the explanation of the built-in\n",
    "`exec` or `eval` functions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "runeval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the *expression* (given as a string or a code object) under\n",
    "debugger control. When `runeval` returns, it returns the value of the\n",

    "\n",
    "runcall(function, *args,*\\*kwds)\n",
    "\n",
    "Call the *function* (a function or method object, not a string) with the\n",
    "given arguments. When `runcall` returns, it returns whatever the\n",
    "function call returned. The debugger prompt appears as soon as the\n",
    "function is entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "set_trace(\\*, header=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the debugger at the calling stack frame. This is useful to\n",
    "hard-code a breakpoint at a given point in a program, even if the code\n",
    "is not otherwise being debugged (e.g. when an assertion fails). If\n",
    "given, *header* is printed to the console just before debugging begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 The keyword-only argument *header*.\n",
    "\n",
    "post_mortem(traceback=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter post-mortem debugging of the given *traceback* object. If no\n",
    "*traceback* is given, it uses the one of the exception that is currently\n",
    "being handled (an exception must be being handled if the default is to\n",
    "be used).\n",
    "\n",
    "pm()\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter post-mortem debugging of the traceback found in\n",
    "`sys.last_traceback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run*` functions and `set_trace` are aliases for instantiating the\n",
    "`Pdb` class and calling the method of the same name. If you want to\n",
    "access further features, you have to do this yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pdb` is the debugger class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *completekey*, *stdin* and *stdout* arguments are passed to the\n",
    "underlying `cmd.Cmd` class; see the description there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *skip* argument, if given, must be an iterable of glob-style module\n",
    "name patterns. The debugger will not step into frames that originate in\n",
    "a module that matches one of these patterns.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Pdb sets a handler for the SIGINT signal (which is sent when\n",
    "the user presses `Ctrl-C` on the console) when you give a `continue`\n",
    "command. This allows you to break into the debugger again by pressing\n",
    "`Ctrl-C`. If you want Pdb not to touch the SIGINT handler, set\n",
    "*nosigint* to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *readrc* argument defaults to true and controls whether Pdb will\n",

    "## Debugger Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands recognized by the debugger are listed below. Most commands\n",
    "can be abbreviated to one or two letters as indicated; e.g. `h(elp)`\n",
    "means that either `h` or `help` can be used to enter the help command\n",
    "(but not `he` or `hel`, nor `H` or `Help` or `HELP`). Arguments to\n",
    "commands must be separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs). Optional\n",
    "arguments are enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) in the command syntax;\n",
    "the square brackets must not be typed. Alternatives in the command\n",
    "syntax are separated by a vertical bar (`|`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Entering a blank line repeats the last command entered. Exception: if\n",
    "the last command was a `list` command, the next 11 lines are listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands that the debugger doesn't recognize are assumed to be Python\n",
    "statements and are executed in the context of the program being\n",
    "debugged. Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation\n",
    "point (`!`). This is a powerful way to inspect the program being\n",
    "debugged; it is even possible to change a variable or call a function.\n",
    "When an exception occurs in such a statement, the exception name is\n",
    "printed but the debugger's state is not changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugger supports `aliases <debugger-aliases>`. Aliases can have\n",
    "parameters which allows one a certain level of adaptability to the\n",
    "context under examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by `;;`. (A\n",
    "single `;` is not used as it is the separator for multiple commands in a\n",
    "line that is passed to the Python parser.) No intelligence is applied to\n",
    "separating the commands; the input is split at the first `;;` pair, even\n",
    "if it is in the middle of a quoted string. A workaround for strings with\n",
    "double semicolons is to use implicit string concatenation `';'';'` or\n",

    "been typed at the debugger prompt. This is particularly useful for\n",
    "aliases. If both files exist, the one in the home directory is read\n",
    "first and aliases defined there can be overridden by the local file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.11 `.pdbrc` is now read with `'utf-8'` encoding. Previously, it was\n",
    "read with the system locale encoding.\n",
