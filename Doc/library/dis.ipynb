    "The `dis` module supports the analysis of CPython `bytecode` by\n",
    "disassembling it. The CPython bytecode which this module takes as an\n",
    "input is defined in the file `Include/opcode.h` and used by the compiler\n",
    "and the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bytecode is an implementation detail of the CPython interpreter. No\n",
    "guarantees are made that bytecode will not be added, removed, or changed\n",
    "between versions of Python. Use of this module should not be considered\n",
    "to work across Python VMs or Python releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 Use 2 bytes for each instruction. Previously the number of bytes\n",
    "varied by instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.11 Some instructions are accompanied by one or more inline cache\n",
    "entries, which take the form of `CACHE` instructions. These instructions\n",
    "are hidden by default, but can be shown by passing `show_caches=True` to\n",
    "any `dis` utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Given the function `myfunc`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def myfunc(alist):\n",
    "        return len(alist)\n",

    "The bytecode analysis API allows pieces of Python code to be wrapped in\n",

    "Analyse the bytecode corresponding to a function, generator,\n",
    "asynchronous generator, coroutine, method, string of source code, or a\n",
    "code object (as returned by `compile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a convenience wrapper around many of the functions listed below,\n",
    "most notably `get_instructions`, as iterating over a `Bytecode` instance\n",
    "yields the bytecode operations as `Instruction` instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *first_line* is not `None`, it indicates the line number that should\n",
    "be reported for the first source line in the disassembled code.\n",
    "Otherwise, the source line information (if any) is taken directly from\n",
    "the disassembled code object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *current_offset* is not `None`, it refers to an instruction offset in\n",
    "the disassembled code. Setting this means `.dis` will display a \"current\n",
    "instruction\" marker against the specified opcode.\n",
    "\n",
