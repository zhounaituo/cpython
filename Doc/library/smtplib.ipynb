    "An `SMTP` instance encapsulates an SMTP connection. It has methods that\n",
    "support a full repertoire of SMTP and ESMTP operations. If the optional\n",
    "host and port parameters are given, the SMTP `connect` method is called\n",
    "with those parameters during initialization. If specified,\n",
    "*local_hostname* is used as the FQDN of the local host in the HELO/EHLO\n",
    "command. Otherwise, the local hostname is found using `socket.getfqdn`.\n",
    "If the `connect` call returns anything other than a success code, an\n",
    "`SMTPConnectError` is raised. The optional *timeout* parameter specifies\n",
    "a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection attempt\n",
    "(if not specified, the global default timeout setting will be used). If\n",
    "the timeout expires, `TimeoutError` is raised. The optional\n",
    "source_address parameter allows binding to some specific source address\n",
    "in a machine with multiple network interfaces, and/or to some specific\n",
    "source TCP port. It takes a 2-tuple (host, port), for the socket to bind\n",
    "to as its source address before connecting. If omitted (or if host or\n",
    "port are `''` and/or 0 respectively) the OS default behavior will be\n",
