    "## Event Loop Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Event loops have **low-level** APIs for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running and stopping the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.run_until_complete(future)\n",
    "\n",
    "Run until the *future* (an instance of `Future`) has completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the argument is a `coroutine object <coroutine>` it is implicitly\n",
    "scheduled to run as a `asyncio.Task`.\n",

    "Return the Future's result or raise its exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.run_forever()\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the event loop until `stop` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `stop` is called before `run_forever()` is called, the loop will poll\n",
    "the I/O selector once with a timeout of zero, run all callbacks\n",
    "scheduled in response to I/O events (and those that were already\n",
    "scheduled), and then exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `stop` is called while `run_forever` is running, the loop will run\n",
    "the current batch of callbacks and then exit. Note that new callbacks\n",
    "scheduled by callbacks will not run in this case; instead, they will run\n",
    "the next time `run_forever` or `run_until_complete` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.stop()\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.is_running()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `True` if the event loop is currently running.\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.is_closed()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `True` if the event loop was closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "Close the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop must not be running when this function is called. Any pending\n",
    "callbacks will be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method clears all queues and shuts down the executor, but does not\n",
    "wait for the executor to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is idempotent and irreversible. No other methods should be\n",
    "called after the event loop is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.shutdown_asyncgens()\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule all currently open `asynchronous generator` objects to close\n",
    "with an `~agen.aclose()` call. After calling this method, the event loop\n",
    "will issue a warning if a new asynchronous generator is iterated. This\n",
    "should be used to reliably finalize all scheduled asynchronous\n",
    "generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no need to call this function when `asyncio.run` is\n",
    "used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        loop.run_forever()\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        loop.run_until_complete(loop.shutdown_asyncgens())\n",
    "        loop.close()\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "loop.shutdown_default_executor()\n",

    "Schedule the closure of the default executor and wait for it to join all\n",
    "of the threads in the `ThreadPoolExecutor`. After calling this method, a\n",

    "using the default executor.\n",

    "used.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Scheduling callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.call_soon(callback, \\*args, context=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule the *callback* `callback` to be called with *args* arguments at\n",
    "the next iteration of the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks are called in the order in which they are registered. Each\n",
    "callback will be called exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a custom\n",

    "This method is not thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "loop.call_soon_threadsafe(callback, \\*args, context=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread-safe variant of `call_soon`. Must be used to schedule callbacks\n",
    "*from another thread*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raises `RuntimeError` if called on a loop that's been closed. This can\n",
    "happen on a secondary thread when the main application is shutting down.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the `concurrency and multithreading <asyncio-multithreading>`\n",
    "section of the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 The *context* keyword-only parameter was added. See `567` for more\n",
    "details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Most `asyncio` scheduling functions don't allow passing keyword\n",
    "arguments. To do that, use `functools.partial`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # will schedule \"print(\"Hello\", flush=True)\"\n",
    "    loop.call_soon(\n",
    "        functools.partial(print, \"Hello\", flush=True))\n",
    "\n",
    "Using partial objects is usually more convenient than using lambdas, as\n",
    "asyncio can render partial objects better in debug and error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scheduling delayed callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Event loop provides mechanisms to schedule callback functions to be\n",
    "called at some point in the future. Event loop uses monotonic clocks to\n",
    "track time.\n",

    "loop.call_later(delay, callback, \\*args, context=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule *callback* to be called after the given *delay* number of\n",
    "seconds (can be either an int or a float).\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of `asyncio.TimerHandle` is returned which can be used to\n",
    "cancel the callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "*callback* will be called exactly once. If two callbacks are scheduled\n",
    "for exactly the same time, the order in which they are called is\n",
    "undefined.\n",
    "\n",

    "called. If you want the callback to be called with keyword arguments use\n",
