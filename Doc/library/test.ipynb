    "The `test` package is meant for internal use by Python only. It is\n",
    "documented for the benefit of the core developers of Python. Any use of\n",
    "this package outside of Python's standard library is discouraged as code\n",
    "mentioned here can change or be removed without notice between releases\n",
    "of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `test` package contains all regression tests for Python as well as\n",
    "the modules `test.support` and `test.regrtest`. `test.support` is used\n",
    "to enhance your tests while `test.regrtest` drives the testing suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module in the `test` package whose name starts with `test_` is a\n",

    "## Writing Unit Tests for the `test` package\n",
    "\n",
    "It is preferred that tests that use the `unittest` module follow a few\n",
    "guidelines. One is to name the test module by starting it with `test_`\n",
    "and end it with the name of the module being tested. The test methods in\n",
    "the test module should start with `test_` and end with a description of\n",
    "what the method is testing. This is needed so that the methods are\n",
    "recognized by the test driver as test methods. Also, no documentation\n",
    "string for the method should be included. A comment (such as\n",
    "`# Tests function returns only True or False`) should be used to provide\n",
    "documentation for test methods. This is done because documentation\n",
    "strings get printed out if they exist and thus what test is being run is\n",
    "not stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic boilerplate is often used:\n",

    "    from test import support\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyTestCase1(unittest.TestCase):\n",

    "on its own as a script that supports the `unittest` CLI, or via the\n",
    "`python -m unittest` CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for regression testing is to try to break code. This leads to a\n",
    "few guidelines to be followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The testing suite should exercise all classes, functions, and\n",
    "    constants. This includes not just the external API that is to be\n",
    "    presented to the outside world but also \"private\" code.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Whitebox testing (examining the code being tested when the tests are\n",
    "    being written) is preferred. Blackbox testing (testing only the\n",
    "    published user interface) is not complete enough to make sure all\n",
    "    boundary and edge cases are tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Make sure all possible values are tested including invalid ones.\n",
    "    This makes sure that not only all valid values are acceptable but\n",
    "    also that improper values are handled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Exhaust as many code paths as possible. Test where branching occurs\n",
    "    and thus tailor input to make sure as many different paths through\n",
    "    the code are taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Add an explicit test for any bugs discovered for the tested code.\n",
    "    This will make sure that the error does not crop up again if the\n",
    "    code is changed in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Make sure to clean up after your tests (such as close and remove all\n",
    "    temporary files).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If a test is dependent on a specific condition of the operating\n",
    "    system then verify the condition already exists before attempting\n",
    "    the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Import as few modules as possible and do it as soon as possible.\n",
    "    This minimizes external dependencies of tests and also minimizes\n",
    "    possible anomalous behavior from side-effects of importing a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Try to maximize code reuse. On occasion, tests will vary by\n",
    "    something as small as what type of input is used. Minimize code\n",
    "    duplication by subclassing a basic test class with a class that\n",
    "    specifies the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "        class TestFuncAcceptsSequencesMixin:\n",
    "\n",
    "            func = mySuperWhammyFunction\n",
    "\n",
    "            def test_func(self):\n",
    "                self.func(self.arg)\n",

    "            arg = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "            arg = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    When using this pattern, remember that all classes that inherit from\n",
    "    `unittest.TestCase` are run as tests. The `Mixin` class in the\n",
    "    example above does not have any data and so can't be run by itself,\n",

    "The `test` package can be run as a script to drive Python's regression\n",
    "test suite, thanks to the `-m` option: `python -m test`. Under the hood,\n",
    "it uses `test.regrtest`; the call `python -m\n",
    "test.regrtest` used in previous Python versions still works. Running the\n",
    "script by itself automatically starts running all regression tests in\n",
    "the `test` package. It does this by finding all modules in the package\n",
    "whose name starts with `test_`, importing them, and executing the\n",
    "function `test_main` if present or loading the tests via\n",
    "unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule if `test_main` does not exist.\n",
    "The names of tests to execute may also be passed to the script.\n",
    "Specifying a single regression test (`python -m test test_spam`) will\n",
    "minimize output and only print whether the test passed or failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `test` directly allows what resources are available for tests to\n",
    "use to be set. You do this by using the `-u` command-line option.\n",
    "Specifying `all` as the value for the `-u` option enables all possible\n",
    "resources: `python -m test -uall`. If all but one resource is desired (a\n",
    "more common case), a comma-separated list of resources that are not\n",
    "desired may be listed after `all`. The command\n",
    "`python -m test -uall,-audio,-largefile` will run `test` with all\n",
    "resources except the `audio` and `largefile` resources. For a list of\n",
    "all resources and more command-line options, run `python -m test -h`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other ways to execute the regression tests depend on what platform\n",
    "the tests are being executed on. On Unix, you can run `make test` at the\n",
