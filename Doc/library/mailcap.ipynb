    "3.11 3.13 The `mailcap` module is deprecated (see\n",
    "`PEP 594 <594#mailcap>` for details). The `mimetypes` module provides an\n",

    "Mailcap files are used to configure how MIME-aware applications such as\n",
    "mail readers and web browsers react to files with different MIME types.\n",
    "(The name \"mailcap\" is derived from the phrase \"mail capability\".) For\n",
    "example, a mailcap file might contain a line like\n",
    "`video/mpeg; xmpeg %s`. Then, if the user encounters an email message or\n",
    "web document with the MIME type `video/mpeg`, `%s` will be replaced by a\n",
    "filename (usually one belonging to a temporary file) and the `xmpeg`\n",
    "program can be automatically started to view the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mailcap format is documented in `1524`, \"A User Agent Configuration\n",
    "Mechanism For Multimedia Mail Format Information\", but is not an\n",
    "internet standard. However, mailcap files are supported on most Unix\n",
    "systems.\n",

    "findmatch(caps, MIMEtype, key='view', filename='/dev/null', plist=\\[\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a 2-tuple; the first element is a string containing the command\n",
    "line to be executed (which can be passed to `os.system`), and the second\n",
    "element is the mailcap entry for a given MIME type. If no matching MIME\n",
    "type can be found, `(None, None)` is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "*key* is the name of the field desired, which represents the type of\n",
    "activity to be performed; the default value is 'view', since in the most\n",
    "common case you simply want to view the body of the MIME-typed data.\n",
    "Other possible values might be 'compose' and 'edit', if you wanted to\n",
    "create a new body of the given MIME type or alter the existing body\n",
    "data. See `1524` for a complete list of these fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "*filename* is the filename to be substituted for `%s` in the command\n",
    "line; the default value is `'/dev/null'` which is almost certainly not\n",
    "what you want, so usually you'll override it by specifying a filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "*plist* can be a list containing named parameters; the default value is\n",
    "simply an empty list. Each entry in the list must be a string containing\n",
    "the parameter name, an equals sign (`'='`), and the parameter's value.\n",
    "Mailcap entries can contain named parameters like `%{foo}`, which will\n",
    "be replaced by the value of the parameter named 'foo'. For example, if\n",
    "the command line `showpartial %{id} %{number} %{total}` was in a mailcap\n",
    "file, and *plist* was set to `['id=1', 'number=2', 'total=3']`, the\n",
    "resulting command line would be `'showpartial 1 2 3'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a mailcap file, the \"test\" field can optionally be specified to test\n",
    "some external condition (such as the machine architecture, or the window\n",
    "system in use) to determine whether or not the mailcap line applies.\n",

    "to know the details of this representation.\n",
