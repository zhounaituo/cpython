    "Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create\n",
    "bindings between a target and an object. For collections that are\n",
    "mutable or contain mutable items, a copy is sometimes needed so one can\n",
    "change one copy without changing the other. This module provides generic\n",

    "The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for\n",
    "compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or\n",
    "class instances):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A *shallow copy* constructs a new compound object and then (to the\n",
    "    extent possible) inserts *references* into it to the objects found\n",
    "    in the original.\n",
    "-   A *deep copy* constructs a new compound object and then,\n",
    "    recursively, inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the\n",
    "    original.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist with\n",
    "shallow copy operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly,\n",
    "    contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop.\n",
    "-   Because deep copy copies everything it may copy too much, such as\n",
    "    data which is intended to be shared between copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `deepcopy` function avoids these problems by:\n",

    "    set of components copied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module does not copy types like module, method, stack trace, stack\n",
    "frame, file, socket, window, or any similar types. It does \"copy\"\n",
    "functions and classes (shallow and deeply), by returning the original\n",
    "object unchanged; this is compatible with the way these are treated by\n",
    "the `pickle` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow copies of dictionaries can be made using `dict.copy`, and of\n",

    "Classes can use the same interfaces to control copying that they use to\n",
    "control pickling. See the description of module `pickle` for information\n",
