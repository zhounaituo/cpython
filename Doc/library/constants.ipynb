    "# Built-in Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "A small number of constants live in the built-in namespace. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "False\n",
    "\n",
    "The false value of the `bool` type. Assignments to `False` are illegal\n",
    "and raise a `SyntaxError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    "The true value of the `bool` type. Assignments to `True` are illegal and\n",
    "raise a `SyntaxError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "None\n",
    "\n",
    "An object frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when\n",
    "default arguments are not passed to a function. Assignments to `None`\n",
    "are illegal and raise a `SyntaxError`. `None` is the sole instance of\n",
    "the `NoneType` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "NotImplemented\n",
    "\n",
    "A special value which should be returned by the binary special methods\n",
    "(e.g. `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__add__`, `__rsub__`, etc.) to indicate that\n",
    "the operation is not implemented with respect to the other type; may be\n",
    "returned by the in-place binary special methods (e.g. `__imul__`,\n",
    "`__iand__`, etc.) for the same purpose. It should not be evaluated in a\n",
    "boolean context. `NotImplemented` is the sole instance of the\n",
    "`types.NotImplementedType` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "When a binary (or in-place) method returns `NotImplemented` the\n",
    "interpreter will try the reflected operation on the other type (or some\n",
    "other fallback, depending on the operator). If all attempts return\n",
    "`NotImplemented`, the interpreter will raise an appropriate exception.\n",
    "Incorrectly returning `NotImplemented` will result in a misleading error\n",
    "message or the `NotImplemented` value being returned to Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `implementing-the-arithmetic-operations` for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "`NotImplementedError` and `NotImplemented` are not interchangeable, even\n",
    "though they have similar names and purposes. See `NotImplementedError`\n",
    "for details on when to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.9 Evaluating `NotImplemented` in a boolean context is deprecated.\n",
    "While it currently evaluates as true, it will emit a\n",
    "`DeprecationWarning`. It will raise a `TypeError` in a future version of\n",
    "Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: ...; ellipsis literal\n",
    "\n",
    "Ellipsis\n",
    "\n",
    "The same as the ellipsis literal \"`...`\". Special value used mostly in\n",
    "conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data\n",
    "types. `Ellipsis` is the sole instance of the `types.EllipsisType` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_\\_debug\\_\\_\n",
    "\n",
    "This constant is true if Python was not started with an `-O` option. See\n",
    "also the `assert` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The names `None`, `False`, `True` and `__debug__` cannot be reassigned\n",
    "(assignments to them, even as an attribute name, raise `SyntaxError`),\n",
    "so they can be considered \"true\" constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constants added by the `site` module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `site` module (which is imported automatically during startup,\n",
    "except if the `-S` command-line option is given) adds several constants\n",
    "to the built-in namespace. They are useful for the interactive\n",
    "interpreter shell and should not be used in programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "quit(code=None) exit(code=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects that when printed, print a message like \"Use quit() or Ctrl-D\n",
    "(i.e. EOF) to exit\", and when called, raise `SystemExit` with the\n",
