    "This module creates temporary files and directories. It works on all\n",
    "supported platforms. `TemporaryFile`, `NamedTemporaryFile`,\n",
    "`TemporaryDirectory`, and `SpooledTemporaryFile` are high-level\n",
    "interfaces which provide automatic cleanup and can be used as context\n",
    "managers. `mkstemp` and `mkdtemp` are lower-level functions which\n",
    "require manual cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the user-callable functions and constructors take additional\n",
    "arguments which allow direct control over the location and name of\n",
    "temporary files and directories. Files names used by this module include\n",
    "a string of random characters which allows those files to be securely\n",
    "created in shared temporary directories. To maintain backward\n",
    "compatibility, the argument order is somewhat odd; it is recommended to\n",
    "use keyword arguments for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module defines the following user-callable items:\n",
    "\n",
    "TemporaryFile(mode='w+b', buffering=-1, encoding=None, newline=None,\n",
    "suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None, \\*, errors=None)\n",

    "area. The file is created securely, using the same rules as `mkstemp`.\n",
    "It will be destroyed as soon as it is closed (including an implicit\n",
    "close when the object is garbage collected). Under Unix, the directory\n",
    "entry for the file is either not created at all or is removed\n",
    "immediately after the file is created. Other platforms do not support\n",
    "this; your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this\n",
    "function having or not having a visible name in the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting object can be used as a context manager (see\n",
    "`tempfile-examples`). On completion of the context or destruction of the\n",
    "file object the temporary file will be removed from the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *mode* parameter defaults to `'w+b'` so that the file created can be\n",
    "read and written without being closed. Binary mode is used so that it\n",
    "behaves consistently on all platforms without regard for the data that\n",
    "is stored. *buffering*, *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* are\n",
    "interpreted as for `open`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *dir*, *prefix* and *suffix* parameters have the same meaning and\n",
    "defaults as with `mkstemp`.\n",

    "with the historical implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of typical usage of the `tempfile` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import tempfile\n",
    "\n",
    "    # create a temporary file and write some data to it\n",
    "    >>> fp = tempfile.TemporaryFile()\n",
    "    >>> fp.write(b'Hello world!')\n",
    "    # read data from file\n",
    "    >>> fp.seek(0)\n",
    "    >>> fp.read()\n",
    "    b'Hello world!'\n",
    "    # close the file, it will be removed\n",
    "    >>> fp.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # create a temporary file using a context manager\n",
    "    >>> with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as fp:\n",
    "    ...     fp.write(b'Hello world!')\n",
    "    ...     fp.seek(0)\n",
    "    ...     fp.read()\n",
    "    b'Hello world!'\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "    # file is now closed and removed\n",
    "\n",
    "    # create a temporary directory using the context manager\n",
    "    >>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:\n",
    "    ...     print('created temporary directory', tmpdirname)\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "    # directory and contents have been removed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deprecated functions and variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A historical way to create temporary files was to first generate a file\n",
    "name with the `mktemp` function and then create a file using this name.\n",
    "Unfortunately this is not secure, because a different process may create\n",
    "a file with this name in the time between the call to `mktemp` and the\n",
    "subsequent attempt to create the file by the first process. The solution\n",
    "is to combine the two steps and create the file immediately. This\n",
    "approach is used by `mkstemp` and the other functions described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "mktemp(suffix='', prefix='tmp', dir=None)\n",

    "2.3 Use `mkstemp` instead.\n",

    "Return an absolute pathname of a file that did not exist at the time the\n",
