    "## Introduction to the profilers\n",
    "\n",
    "single: deterministic profiling single: profiling, deterministic\n",
    "\n",
    "`cProfile` and `profile` provide `deterministic profiling` of Python\n",
    "programs. A `profile` is a set of statistics that describes how often\n",
    "and for how long various parts of the program executed. These statistics\n",
    "can be formatted into reports via the `pstats` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python standard library provides two different implementations of\n",
    "the same profiling interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `cProfile` is recommended for most users; it's a C extension with\n",
    "    reasonable overhead that makes it suitable for profiling\n",
    "    long-running programs. Based on `lsprof`, contributed by Brett Rosen\n",
    "    and Ted Czotter.\n",
    "2.  `profile`, a pure Python module whose interface is imitated by\n",
    "    `cProfile`, but which adds significant overhead to profiled\n",
    "    programs. If you're trying to extend the profiler in some way, the\n",
    "    task might be easier with this module. Originally designed and\n",
    "    written by Jim Roskind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The profiler modules are designed to provide an execution profile for a\n",
    "given program, not for benchmarking purposes (for that, there is\n",
    "`timeit` for reasonably accurate results). This particularly applies to\n",
    "benchmarking Python code against C code: the profilers introduce\n",
    "overhead for Python code, but not for C-level functions, and so the C\n",
    "code would seem faster than any Python one.\n",

    "It provides a very brief overview, and allows a user to rapidly perform\n",

    "    import re\n",
    "    cProfile.run('re.compile(\"foo|bar\")')\n",

    "(Use `profile` instead of `cProfile` if the latter is not available on\n",
    "your system.)\n",

    "    p.print_stats()\n",

    "\n",
    "    p.sort_stats(SortKey.CUMULATIVE).print_stats(10)\n",

    "\n",
    "    p.sort_stats(SortKey.FILENAME).print_stats('__init__')\n",

    "\n",
    "run(command, filename=None, sort=-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes a single argument that can be passed to the `exec`\n",

    "runctx(command, globals, locals, filename=None, sort=-1)\n",

    "\n",
    "This class is normally only used if more precise control over profiling\n",
    "is needed than what the `cProfile.run` function provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom timer can be supplied for measuring how long code takes to run\n",
    "via the *timer* argument. This must be a function that returns a single\n",
    "number representing the current time. If the number is an integer, the\n",
    "*timeunit* specifies a multiplier that specifies the duration of each\n",
    "unit of time. For example, if the timer returns times measured in\n",
    "thousands of seconds, the time unit would be `.001`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly using the `Profile` class allows formatting profile results\n",
    "without writing the profile data to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import cProfile, pstats, io\n",

    "considered in a single report. If additional files need to be combined\n",
    "with data in an existing `~pstats.Stats` object, the `~pstats.Stats.add`\n",

    "and the stripped information is lost. After performing a strip\n",

    "## What Is Deterministic Profiling?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Deterministic profiling` is meant to reflect the fact that all\n",
    "*function call*, *function return*, and *exception* events are\n",
    "monitored, and precise timings are made for the intervals between these\n",
    "events (during which time the user's code is executing). In contrast,\n",
    "`statistical profiling` (which is not done by this module) randomly\n",
    "samples the effective instruction pointer, and deduces where time is\n",
    "being spent. The latter technique traditionally involves less overhead\n",
    "(as the code does not need to be instrumented), but provides only\n",
    "relative indications of where time is being spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, since there is an interpreter active during execution, the\n",
    "presence of instrumented code is not required in order to do\n",
    "deterministic profiling. Python automatically provides a `hook`\n",
    "(optional callback) for each event. In addition, the interpreted nature\n",
    "of Python tends to add so much overhead to execution, that deterministic\n",
    "profiling tends to only add small processing overhead in typical\n",
    "applications. The result is that deterministic profiling is not that\n",
    "expensive, yet provides extensive run time statistics about the\n",
    "execution of a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call count statistics can be used to identify bugs in code (surprising\n",
    "counts), and to identify possible inline-expansion points (high call\n",
    "counts). Internal time statistics can be used to identify \"hot loops\"\n",
    "that should be carefully optimized. Cumulative time statistics should be\n",
    "used to identify high level errors in the selection of algorithms. Note\n",
    "that the unusual handling of cumulative times in this profiler allows\n",
    "statistics for recursive implementations of algorithms to be directly\n",
    "compared to iterative implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation has to do with accuracy of timing information. There is a\n",
    "fundamental problem with deterministic profilers involving accuracy. The\n",
    "most obvious restriction is that the underlying \"clock\" is only ticking\n",
    "at a rate (typically) of about .001 seconds. Hence no measurements will\n",
    "be more accurate than the underlying clock. If enough measurements are\n",
    "taken, then the \"error\" will tend to average out. Unfortunately,\n",
    "removing this first error induces a second source of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second problem is that it \"takes a while\" from when an event is\n",
    "dispatched until the profiler's call to get the time actually *gets* the\n",
    "state of the clock. Similarly, there is a certain lag when exiting the\n",
    "profiler event handler from the time that the clock's value was obtained\n",
    "(and then squirreled away), until the user's code is once again\n",
    "executing. As a result, functions that are called many times, or call\n",
    "many functions, will typically accumulate this error. The error that\n",
    "accumulates in this fashion is typically less than the accuracy of the\n",
    "clock (less than one clock tick), but it *can* accumulate and become\n",
    "very significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is more important with `profile` than with the\n",
    "lower-overhead `cProfile`. For this reason, `profile` provides a means\n",
    "of calibrating itself for a given platform so that this error can be\n",
    "probabilistically (on the average) removed. After the profiler is\n",
    "calibrated, it will be more accurate (in a least square sense), but it\n",
    "will sometimes produce negative numbers (when call counts are\n",
    "exceptionally low, and the gods of probability work against you :-). )\n",
    "Do *not* be alarmed by negative numbers in the profile. They should\n",
    "*only* appear if you have calibrated your profiler, and the results are\n",
    "actually better than without calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "The profiler of the `profile` module subtracts a constant from each\n",
    "event handling time to compensate for the overhead of calling the time\n",
    "function, and socking away the results. By default, the constant is 0.\n",
    "The following procedure can be used to obtain a better constant for a\n",
    "given platform (see `profile-limitations`). :\n",
    "\n",
    "    import profile\n",
    "    pr = profile.Profile()\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        print(pr.calibrate(10000))\n",
    "\n",
    "The method executes the number of Python calls given by the argument,\n",
    "directly and again under the profiler, measuring the time for both. It\n",
    "then computes the hidden overhead per profiler event, and returns that\n",
    "as a float. For example, on a 1.8Ghz Intel Core i5 running macOS, and\n",
    "using Python's time.process_time() as the timer, the magical number is\n",
    "about 4.04e-6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object of this exercise is to get a fairly consistent result. If\n",
    "your computer is *very* fast, or your timer function has poor\n",
    "resolution, you might have to pass 100000, or even 1000000, to get\n",
    "consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a consistent answer, there are three ways you can use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import profile\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 1. Apply computed bias to all Profile instances created hereafter.\n",
    "    profile.Profile.bias = your_computed_bias\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Apply computed bias to a specific Profile instance.\n",
    "    pr = profile.Profile()\n",
    "    pr.bias = your_computed_bias\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 3. Specify computed bias in instance constructor.\n",
    "    pr = profile.Profile(bias=your_computed_bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a choice, you are better off choosing a smaller constant,\n",
    "and then your results will \"less often\" show up as negative in profile\n",
    "statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a custom timer\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change how current time is determined (for example, to\n",
    "force use of wall-clock time or elapsed process time), pass the timing\n",
    "function you want to the `Profile` class constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pr = profile.Profile(your_time_func)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting profiler will then call `your_time_func`. Depending on\n",
    "whether you are using `profile.Profile` or `cProfile.Profile`,\n",
    "`your_time_func`'s return value will be interpreted differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "`profile.Profile`  \n",
    "`your_time_func` should return a single number, or a list of numbers\n",
    "whose sum is the current time (like what `os.times` returns). If the\n",
    "function returns a single time number, or the list of returned numbers\n",
    "has length 2, then you will get an especially fast version of the\n",
    "dispatch routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be warned that you should calibrate the profiler class for the timer\n",
    "function that you choose (see `profile-calibration`). For most machines,\n",
    "a timer that returns a lone integer value will provide the best results\n",
    "in terms of low overhead during profiling. (`os.times` is *pretty* bad,\n",
    "as it returns a tuple of floating point values). If you want to\n",
    "substitute a better timer in the cleanest fashion, derive a class and\n",
    "hardwire a replacement dispatch method that best handles your timer\n",
    "call, along with the appropriate calibration constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cProfile.Profile`  \n",
    "`your_time_func` should return a single number. If it returns integers,\n",
    "you can also invoke the class constructor with a second argument\n",
    "specifying the real duration of one unit of time. For example, if\n",
    "`your_integer_time_func` returns times measured in thousands of seconds,\n",
    "you would construct the `Profile` instance as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pr = cProfile.Profile(your_integer_time_func, 0.001)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the `cProfile.Profile` class cannot be calibrated, custom timer\n",
    "functions should be used with care and should be as fast as possible.\n",
    "For the best results with a custom timer, it might be necessary to\n",
    "hard-code it in the C source of the internal `_lsprof` module.\n",
    "\n",

    "precise measurements of process or wall-clock time. For example, see\n",
