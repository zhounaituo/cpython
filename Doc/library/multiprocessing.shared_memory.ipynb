    "In this module, shared memory refers to \"System V style\" shared memory\n",
    "blocks (though is not necessarily implemented explicitly as such) and\n",
    "does not refer to \"distributed shared memory\". This style of shared\n",
    "memory permits distinct processes to potentially read and write to a\n",
    "common (or shared) region of volatile memory. Processes are\n",
    "conventionally limited to only have access to their own process memory\n",
    "space but shared memory permits the sharing of data between processes,\n",
    "avoiding the need to instead send messages between processes containing\n",
    "that data. Sharing data directly via memory can provide significant\n",

    "may outlive the original process that created them. When one process no\n",

    "after `unlink()` has been called may result in memory access errors.\n",
