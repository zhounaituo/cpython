    "The `pickle` module implements binary protocols for serializing and\n",
    "de-serializing a Python object structure. *\"Pickling\"* is the process\n",
    "whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and\n",
    "*\"unpickling\"* is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a\n",
    "`binary file` or `bytes-like object`) is converted back into an object\n",
    "hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as\n",
    "\"serialization\", \"marshalling,\"[1] or \"flattening\"; however, to avoid\n",
    "confusion, the terms used here are \"pickling\" and \"unpickling\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pickle` module **is not secure**. Only unpickle data you trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will **execute\n",
    "arbitrary code during unpickling**. Never unpickle data that could have\n",
    "come from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider signing data with `hmac` if you need to ensure that it has not\n",
    "been tampered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Safer serialization formats such as `json` may be more appropriate if\n",
    "you are processing untrusted data. See `comparison-with-json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationship to other Python modules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with `marshal`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a more primitive serialization module called `marshal`, but\n",
    "in general `pickle` should always be the preferred way to serialize\n",
    "Python objects. `marshal` exists primarily to support Python's `.pyc`\n",
    "files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pickle` module differs from `marshal` in several significant ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `pickle` module keeps track of the objects it has already\n",
    "    serialized, so that later references to the same object won't be\n",
    "    serialized again. `marshal` doesn't do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This has implications both for recursive objects and object sharing.\n",
    "    Recursive objects are objects that contain references to themselves.\n",
    "    These are not handled by marshal, and in fact, attempting to marshal\n",
    "    recursive objects will crash your Python interpreter. Object sharing\n",
    "    happens when there are multiple references to the same object in\n",
    "    different places in the object hierarchy being serialized. `pickle`\n",
    "    stores such objects only once, and ensures that all other references\n",
    "    point to the master copy. Shared objects remain shared, which can be\n",
    "    very important for mutable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `marshal` cannot be used to serialize user-defined classes and their\n",
    "    instances. `pickle` can save and restore class instances\n",
    "    transparently, however the class definition must be importable and\n",
    "    live in the same module as when the object was stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `marshal` serialization format is not guaranteed to be portable\n",
    "    across Python versions. Because its primary job in life is to\n",
    "    support `.pyc` files, the Python implementers reserve the right to\n",
    "    change the serialization format in non-backwards compatible ways\n",
    "    should the need arise. The `pickle` serialization format is\n",
    "    guaranteed to be backwards compatible across Python releases\n",
    "    provided a compatible pickle protocol is chosen and pickling and\n",
    "    unpickling code deals with Python 2 to Python 3 type differences if\n",
    "    your data is crossing that unique breaking change language boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with `json`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are fundamental differences between the pickle protocols and [JSON\n",
    "(JavaScript Object Notation)](http://json.org):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   JSON is a text serialization format (it outputs unicode text,\n",
    "    although most of the time it is then encoded to `utf-8`), while\n",
    "    pickle is a binary serialization format;\n",
    "-   JSON is human-readable, while pickle is not;\n",
    "-   JSON is interoperable and widely used outside of the Python\n",
    "    ecosystem, while pickle is Python-specific;\n",
    "-   JSON, by default, can only represent a subset of the Python built-in\n",
    "    types, and no custom classes; pickle can represent an extremely\n",
    "    large number of Python types (many of them automatically, by clever\n",
    "    usage of Python's introspection facilities; complex cases can be\n",
    "    tackled by implementing `specific object APIs <pickle-inst>`);\n",
    "-   Unlike pickle, deserializing untrusted JSON does not in itself\n",
    "    create an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `json` module: a standard library module allowing JSON serialization\n",
    "and deserialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data stream format\n",
    "\n",
    "single: External Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data format used by `pickle` is Python-specific. This has the\n",
    "advantage that there are no restrictions imposed by external standards\n",
    "such as JSON or XDR (which can't represent pointer sharing); however it\n",
    "means that non-Python programs may not be able to reconstruct pickled\n",
    "Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the `pickle` data format uses a relatively compact binary\n",
    "representation. If you need optimal size characteristics, you can\n",
    "efficiently `compress <archiving>` pickled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `pickletools` contains tools for analyzing data streams\n",
    "generated by `pickle`. `pickletools` source code has extensive comments\n",
    "about opcodes used by pickle protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently 6 different protocols which can be used for\n",
    "pickling. The higher the protocol used, the more recent the version of\n",
    "Python needed to read the pickle produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Protocol version 0 is the original \"human-readable\" protocol and is\n",
    "    backwards compatible with earlier versions of Python.\n",
    "-   Protocol version 1 is an old binary format which is also compatible\n",
    "    with earlier versions of Python.\n",
    "-   Protocol version 2 was introduced in Python 2.3. It provides much\n",
    "    more efficient pickling of `new-style classes <new-style class>`.\n",
    "    Refer to `307` for information about improvements brought by\n",
    "    protocol 2.\n",
    "-   Protocol version 3 was added in Python 3.0. It has explicit support\n",
    "    for `bytes` objects and cannot be unpickled by Python 2.x. This was\n",
    "    the default protocol in Python 3.0--3.7.\n",
    "-   Protocol version 4 was added in Python 3.4. It adds support for very\n",
    "    large objects, pickling more kinds of objects, and some data format\n",
    "    optimizations. It is the default protocol starting with Python 3.8.\n",
    "    Refer to `3154` for information about improvements brought by\n",
    "    protocol 4.\n",
    "-   Protocol version 5 was added in Python 3.8. It adds support for\n",
    "    out-of-band data and speedup for in-band data. Refer to `574` for\n",
    "    information about improvements brought by protocol 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Serialization is a more primitive notion than persistence; although\n",
    "`pickle` reads and writes file objects, it does not handle the issue of\n",
    "naming persistent objects, nor the (even more complicated) issue of\n",
    "concurrent access to persistent objects. The `pickle` module can\n",
    "transform a complex object into a byte stream and it can transform the\n",
    "byte stream into an object with the same internal structure. Perhaps the\n",
    "most obvious thing to do with these byte streams is to write them onto a\n",
    "file, but it is also conceivable to send them across a network or store\n",
    "them in a database. The `shelve` module provides a simple interface to\n",
    "pickle and unpickle objects on DBM-style database files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "To serialize an object hierarchy, you simply call the `dumps` function.\n",
    "Similarly, to de-serialize a data stream, you call the `loads` function.\n",
    "However, if you want more control over serialization and\n",
    "de-serialization, you can create a `Pickler` or an `Unpickler` object,\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pickle` module provides the following constants:\n",
    "\n",
    "HIGHEST_PROTOCOL\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer, the highest `protocol version <pickle-protocols>` available.\n",
    "This value can be passed as a *protocol* value to functions `dump` and\n",
    "`dumps` as well as the `Pickler` constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "DEFAULT_PROTOCOL\n",
