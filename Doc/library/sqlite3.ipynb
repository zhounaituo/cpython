    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database\n",
    "that doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the\n",
    "database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some\n",
    "applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It's also\n",
    "possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code\n",
    "to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sqlite3 module was written by Gerhard Häring. It provides an SQL\n",
    "interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by\n",
    "`249`, and requires SQLite 3.7.15 or newer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the module, start by creating a `Connection` object that\n",
    "represents the database. Here the data will be stored in the\n",
    "`example.db` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import sqlite3\n",
    "    con = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n",
    "\n",
    "The special path name `:memory:` can be provided to create a temporary\n",
    "database in RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a `Connection` has been established, create a `Cursor` object and\n",
    "call its `~Cursor.execute` method to perform SQL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cur = con.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create table\n",
    "    cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE stocks\n",
    "                   (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)''')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Insert a row of data\n",
    "    cur.execute(\"INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2006-01-05','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Save (commit) the changes\n",
    "    con.commit()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # We can also close the connection if we are done with it.\n",
    "    # Just be sure any changes have been committed or they will be lost.\n",
    "    con.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "The saved data is persistent: it can be reloaded in a subsequent session\n",
    "even after restarting the Python interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import sqlite3\n",
    "    con = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n",
    "    cur = con.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve data after executing a SELECT statement, either treat the\n",
    "cursor as an `iterator`, call the cursor's `~Cursor.fetchone` method to\n",
    "retrieve a single matching row, or call `~Cursor.fetchall` to get a list\n",
    "of the matching rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the iterator form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> for row in cur.execute('SELECT * FROM stocks ORDER BY price'):\n",
    "            print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ('2006-01-05', 'BUY', 'RHAT', 100, 35.14)\n",
    "    ('2006-03-28', 'BUY', 'IBM', 1000, 45.0)\n",
    "    ('2006-04-06', 'SELL', 'IBM', 500, 53.0)\n",
    "    ('2006-04-05', 'BUY', 'MSFT', 1000, 72.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL operations usually need to use values from Python variables.\n",
    "However, beware of using Python's string operations to assemble queries,\n",
    "as they are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks (see the [xkcd\n",
    "webcomic](https://xkcd.com/327/) for a humorous example of what can go\n",
    "wrong):\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Never do this -- insecure!\n",
    "    symbol = 'RHAT'\n",
    "    cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol = '%s'\" % symbol)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, use the DB-API's parameter substitution. To insert a variable\n",
    "into a query string, use a placeholder in the string, and substitute the\n",
    "actual values into the query by providing them as a `tuple` of values to\n",
    "the second argument of the cursor's `~Cursor.execute` method. An SQL\n",
    "statement may use one of two kinds of placeholders: question marks\n",
    "(qmark style) or named placeholders (named style). For the qmark style,\n",
    "`parameters` must be a `sequence <sequence>`. For the named style, it\n",
    "can be either a `sequence <sequence>` or `dict` instance. The length of\n",
    "the `sequence <sequence>` must match the number of placeholders, or a\n",

    "The type system of the `sqlite3` module is extensible in two ways: you\n",
    "can store additional Python types in an SQLite database via object\n",
    "adaptation, and you can let the `sqlite3` module convert SQLite types to\n",
    "different Python types via converters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using adapters to store additional Python types in SQLite databases\n",
    "\n",
    "As described before, SQLite supports only a limited set of types\n",
    "natively. To use other Python types with SQLite, you must **adapt** them\n",
    "to one of the sqlite3 module's supported types for SQLite: one of\n",
    "NoneType, int, float, str, bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to enable the `sqlite3` module to adapt a custom\n",
    "Python type to one of the supported ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Letting your object adapt itself\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good approach if you write the class yourself. Let's suppose\n",
    "you have a class like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Point:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "            self.x, self.y = x, y\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you want to store the point in a single SQLite column. First you'll\n",
    "have to choose one of the supported types to be used for representing\n",
    "the point. Let's just use str and separate the coordinates using a\n",
    "semicolon. Then you need to give your class a method\n",
    "`__conform__(self, protocol)` which must return the converted value. The\n",
    "parameter *protocol* will be `PrepareProtocol`.\n",
    "\n",
    "../includes/sqlite3/adapter_point_1.py\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Registering an adapter callable\n",
    "\n",
    "The other possibility is to create a function that converts the type to\n",
    "the string representation and register the function with\n",
    "`register_adapter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "../includes/sqlite3/adapter_point_2.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sqlite3` module has two default adapters for Python's built-in\n",
    "`datetime.date` and `datetime.datetime` types. Now let's suppose we want\n",
    "to store `datetime.datetime` objects not in ISO representation, but as a\n",
    "Unix timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "../includes/sqlite3/adapter_datetime.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting SQLite values to custom Python types\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing an adapter lets you send custom Python types to SQLite. But to\n",
    "make it really useful we need to make the Python to SQLite to Python\n",
    "roundtrip work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter converters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to the `Point` class. We stored the x and y coordinates\n",
    "separated via semicolons as strings in SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll define a converter function that accepts the string as a\n",
    "parameter and constructs a `Point` object from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Converter functions **always** get called with a `bytes` object, no\n",
    "matter under which data type you sent the value to SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def convert_point(s):\n",
    "        x, y = map(float, s.split(b\";\"))\n",
    "        return Point(x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to make the `sqlite3` module know that what you select from\n",
    "the database is actually a point. There are two ways of doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Implicitly via the declared type\n",
    "-   Explicitly via the column name\n",
    "\n",
    "Both ways are described in section `sqlite3-module-contents`, in the\n",
    "entries for the constants `PARSE_DECLTYPES` and `PARSE_COLNAMES`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example illustrates both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "../includes/sqlite3/converter_point.py\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default adapters and converters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are default adapters for the date and datetime types in the\n",
    "datetime module. They will be sent as ISO dates/ISO timestamps to\n",
    "SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default converters are registered under the name \"date\" for\n",
    "`datetime.date` and under the name \"timestamp\" for `datetime.datetime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you can use date/timestamps from Python without any additional\n",
    "fiddling in most cases. The format of the adapters is also compatible\n",
    "with the experimental SQLite date/time functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates this.\n",
    "\n",
    "../includes/sqlite3/pysqlite_datetime.py\n",
    "\n",
    "If a timestamp stored in SQLite has a fractional part longer than 6\n",
    "numbers, its value will be truncated to microsecond precision by the\n",
    "timestamp converter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The default \"timestamp\" converter ignores UTC offsets in the database\n",
    "and always returns a naive `datetime.datetime` object. To preserve UTC\n",
    "offsets in timestamps, either leave converters disabled, or register an\n",
    "offset-aware converter with `register_converter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controlling Transactions\n",

    "The underlying `sqlite3` library operates in `autocommit` mode by\n",
    "default, but the Python `sqlite3` module by default does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "`autocommit` mode means that statements that modify the database take\n",
    "effect immediately. A `BEGIN` or `SAVEPOINT` statement disables\n",
    "`autocommit` mode, and a `COMMIT`, a `ROLLBACK`, or a `RELEASE` that\n",
    "ends the outermost transaction, turns `autocommit` mode back on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python `sqlite3` module by default issues a `BEGIN` statement\n",
    "implicitly before a Data Modification Language (DML) statement (i.e.\n",
    "`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`REPLACE`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control which kind of `BEGIN` statements `sqlite3` implicitly\n",
    "executes via the *isolation_level* parameter to the `connect` call, or\n",
    "via the `isolation_level` property of connections. If you specify no\n",
    "*isolation_level*, a plain `BEGIN` is used, which is equivalent to\n",
    "specifying `DEFERRED`. Other possible values are `IMMEDIATE` and\n",
    "`EXCLUSIVE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can disable the `sqlite3` module's implicit transaction management\n",
    "by setting `isolation_level` to `None`. This will leave the underlying\n",
    "`sqlite3` library operating in `autocommit` mode. You can then\n",
    "completely control the transaction state by explicitly issuing `BEGIN`,\n",
    "`ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, and `RELEASE` statements in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `~Cursor.executescript` disregards `isolation_level`; any\n",
    "transaction control must be added explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 `sqlite3` used to implicitly commit an open transaction before DDL\n",
    "statements. This is no longer the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `sqlite3` efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using shortcut methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the nonstandard `execute`, `executemany` and `executescript`\n",
    "methods of the `Connection` object, your code can be written more\n",
    "concisely because you don't have to create the (often superfluous)\n",
    "`Cursor` objects explicitly. Instead, the `Cursor` objects are created\n",
    "implicitly and these shortcut methods return the cursor objects. This\n",
