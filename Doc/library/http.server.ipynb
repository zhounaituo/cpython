    "This class builds on the `~socketserver.TCPServer` class by storing the\n",

    "through the handler's `server` instance variable.\n",

    "This class is identical to HTTPServer but uses threads to handle\n",

    "\n",
    "If the request was mapped to a directory, the directory is checked for a\n",
    "file named `index.html` or `index.htm` (in that order). If found, the\n",

    "If the request was mapped to a file, it is opened. Any `OSError`\n",
