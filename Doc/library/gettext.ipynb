    "The `gettext` module provides internationalization (I18N) and\n",
    "localization (L10N) services for your Python modules and applications.\n",
    "It supports both the GNU `gettext` message catalog API and a higher\n",
    "level, class-based API that may be more appropriate for Python files.\n",
    "The interface described below allows you to write your module and\n",
    "application messages in one natural language, and provide a catalog of\n",
    "translated messages for running under different natural languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hints on localizing your Python modules and applications are also\n",
    "given.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GNU `gettext` API\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gettext` module defines the following API, which is very similar to\n",
    "the GNU `gettext` API. If you use this API you will affect the\n",
    "translation of your entire application globally. Often this is what you\n",
    "want if your application is monolingual, with the choice of language\n",
    "dependent on the locale of your user. If you are localizing a Python\n",
    "module, or if your application needs to switch languages on the fly, you\n",
    "probably want to use the class-based API instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "bindtextdomain(domain, localedir=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bind the *domain* to the locale directory *localedir*. More concretely,\n",
    "`gettext` will look for binary `.mo` files for the given domain using\n",
    "the path (on Unix): `{localedir}/{language}/LC_MESSAGES/{domain}.mo`,\n",
    "where *language* is searched for in the environment variables\n",
    "`LANGUAGE`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, and `LANG` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *localedir* is omitted or `None`, then the current binding for\n",
    "*domain* is returned.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "textdomain(domain=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Change or query the current global domain. If *domain* is `None`, then\n",
    "the current global domain is returned, otherwise the global domain is\n",

    "dgettext(domain, message)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `.gettext`, but look the message up in the specified *domain*.\n",
    "\n",
    "ngettext(singular, plural, n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `.gettext`, but consider plural forms. If a translation is found,\n",
    "apply the plural formula to *n*, and return the resulting message (some\n",
    "languages have more than two plural forms). If no translation is found,\n",
    "return *singular* if *n* is 1; return *plural* otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plural formula is taken from the catalog header. It is a C or Python\n",
    "expression that has a free variable *n*; the expression evaluates to the\n",
    "index of the plural in the catalog. See [the GNU gettext\n",
    "documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html)\n",

    "Note that GNU `gettext` also defines a `dcgettext` method, but this was\n",

    "## Class-based API\n",
    "\n",
    "The class-based API of the `gettext` module gives you more flexibility\n",

    "strings, where each string is a language code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *localedir* is not given, then the default system locale directory is\n",
    "used. [2] If *languages* is not given, then the following environment\n",

    "The first one returning a non-empty value is used for the *languages*\n",
    "variable. The environment variables should contain a colon separated\n",
    "list of languages, which will be split on the colon to produce the\n",
    "expected list of language code strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "`find` then expands and normalizes the languages, and then iterates\n",
    "through them, searching for an existing file built of these components:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{localedir}/{language}/LC_MESSAGES/{domain}.mo`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first such file name that exists is returned by `find`. If no such\n",

    "are cached. The actual class instantiated is *class\\_* if provided,\n",
    "otherwise `GNUTranslations`. The class's constructor must take a single\n",

    "function, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(_('This string will be translated.'))\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### The `NullTranslations` class\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation classes are what actually implement the translation of\n",
    "original source file message strings to translated message strings. The\n",
    "base class used by all translation classes is `NullTranslations`; this\n",
    "provides the basic interface you can use to write your own specialized\n",

    "Takes an optional `file object` *fp*, which is ignored by the base\n",
    "class. Initializes \"protected\" instance variables *\\_info* and\n",
    "*\\_charset* which are set by derived classes, as well as *\\_fallback*,\n",
    "which is set through `add_fallback`. It then calls `self._parse(fp)` if\n",
    "*fp* is not `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\_parse(fp)\n",
    "\n",
    "No-op in the base class, this method takes file object *fp*, and reads\n",

    "### The `GNUTranslations` class\n",

    "`key: value` pairs, and should contain the `Project-Id-Version` key. If\n",

    "message ids and message strings read from the catalog are converted to\n",
    "Unicode using this encoding, else ASCII is assumed.\n",

    "Since message ids are read as Unicode strings too, all `*gettext`\n",

    "    strings\n",
    "2.  run a suite of tools over your marked files to generate raw messages\n",
    "    catalogs\n",
    "3.  create language-specific translations of the message catalogs\n",
    "4.  use the `gettext` module so that message strings are properly\n",
    "    translated\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to prepare your code for I18N, you need to look at all the\n",

    "\n",
    "In most coding situations, strings are translated where they are coded.\n",
    "Occasionally however, you need to mark strings for translation, but\n",
    "defer actual translation until later. A classic example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    animals = ['mollusk',\n",
    "               'albatross',\n",
    "               'rat',\n",
    "               'penguin',\n",
    "               'python', ]\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    for a in animals:\n",
    "        print(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you want to mark the strings in the `animals` list as being\n",
    "translatable, but you don't actually want to translate them until they\n",
    "are printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is one way you can handle this situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _(message): return message\n",
    "\n",
    "    animals = [_('mollusk'),\n",
    "               _('albatross'),\n",
    "               _('rat'),\n",
    "               _('penguin'),\n",
    "               _('python'), ]\n",
    "\n",
    "    del _\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    for a in animals:\n",
    "        print(_(a))\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because the dummy definition of `_` simply returns the string\n",
    "unchanged. And this dummy definition will temporarily override any\n",
    "definition of `_` in the built-in namespace (until the `del` command).\n",
    "Take care, though if you have a previous definition of `_` in the local\n",
    "namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the second use of `_` will not identify \"a\" as being\n",
    "translatable to the `gettext` program, because the parameter is not a\n",
    "string literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to handle this is with the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def N_(message): return message\n",
    "\n",
    "    animals = [N_('mollusk'),\n",
    "               N_('albatross'),\n",
    "               N_('rat'),\n",
    "               N_('penguin'),\n",
    "               N_('python'), ]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    for a in animals:\n",
    "        print(_(a))\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you are marking translatable strings with the function\n",
    "`N_`, which won't conflict with any definition of `_`. However, you will\n",
    "need to teach your message extraction program to look for translatable\n",
    "strings marked with `N_`. `xgettext`, `pygettext`, `pybabel extract`,\n",
    "and `xpot` all support this through the use of the `!-k` command-line\n",
    "switch. The choice of `N_` here is totally arbitrary; it could have just\n",
    "as easily been `MarkThisStringForTranslation`.\n",
