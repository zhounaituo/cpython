    "Note: The code samples in this tutorial use `doctest` to make sure that\n",
    "they actually work. Since some code samples behave differently under\n",
    "Linux, Windows, or macOS, they contain doctest directives in comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Some code samples reference the ctypes `c_int` type. On platforms\n",
