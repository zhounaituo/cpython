    "# `email.mime`: Creating email and MIME objects from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "email.mime\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source code:** `Lib/email/mime/`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is part of the legacy (`Compat32`) email API. Its\n",
    "functionality is partially replaced by the `~email.contentmanager` in\n",
    "the new API, but in certain applications these classes may still be\n",
    "useful, even in non-legacy code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinarily, you get a message object structure by passing a file or some\n",
    "text to a parser, which parses the text and returns the root message\n",
    "object. However you can also build a complete message structure from\n",
    "scratch, or even individual `~email.message.Message` objects by hand. In\n",
    "fact, you can also take an existing structure and add new\n",
    "`~email.message.Message` objects, move them around, etc. This makes a\n",
    "very convenient interface for slicing-and-dicing MIME messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a new object structure by creating\n",
    "`~email.message.Message` instances, adding attachments and all the\n",
    "appropriate headers manually. For MIME messages though, the `email`\n",
    "package provides some convenient subclasses to make things easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "email.mime.base\n",
    "\n",
    "Module: `email.mime.base`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the base class for all the MIME-specific subclasses of\n",
    "`~email.message.Message`. Ordinarily you won't create instances\n",
    "specifically of `MIMEBase`, although you could. `MIMEBase` is provided\n",
    "primarily as a convenient base class for more specific MIME-aware\n",
    "subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\\_maintype* is the `Content-Type` major type (e.g. `text` or `image`),\n",
    "and *\\_subtype* is the `Content-Type` minor type (e.g. `plain` or\n",
    "`gif`). *\\_params* is a parameter key/value dictionary and is passed\n",
    "directly to `Message.add_header\n",
    "<email.message.Message.add_header>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *policy* is specified, (defaults to the\n",
    "`compat32 <email.policy.Compat32>` policy) it will be passed to\n",
    "`~email.message.Message`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MIMEBase` class always adds a `Content-Type` header (based on\n",
    "*\\_maintype*, *\\_subtype*, and *\\_params*), and a `MIME-Version` header\n",
    "(always set to `1.0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 Added *policy* keyword-only parameter.\n",
    "\n",

    "A subclass of `~email.mime.base.MIMEBase`, this is an intermediate base\n",
    "class for MIME messages that are not `multipart`. The primary purpose of\n",
    "this class is to prevent the use of the `~email.message.Message.attach`\n",
    "method, which only makes sense for `multipart` messages. If\n",

    "Optional *boundary* is the multipart boundary string. When `None` (the\n",
    "default), the boundary is calculated when needed (for example, when the\n",
