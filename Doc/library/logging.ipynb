    "\n",
    "This module defines functions and classes which implement a flexible\n",
    "event logging system for applications and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key benefit of having the logging API provided by a standard library\n",
    "module is that all Python modules can participate in logging, so your\n",
    "application log can include your own messages integrated with messages\n",
    "from third-party modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module provides a lot of functionality and flexibility. If you are\n",
    "unfamiliar with logging, the best way to get to grips with it is to see\n",
    "the tutorials (see the links on the right).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic classes defined by the module, together with their functions,\n",
    "are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Loggers expose the interface that application code directly uses.\n",
    "-   Handlers send the log records (created by loggers) to the\n",
    "    appropriate destination.\n",
    "-   Filters provide a finer grained facility for determining which log\n",
    "    records to output.\n",
    "-   Formatters specify the layout of log records in the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logger Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Loggers have the following attributes and methods. Note that Loggers\n",
    "should *NEVER* be instantiated directly, but always through the\n",
    "module-level function `logging.getLogger(name)`. Multiple calls to\n",
    "`getLogger` with the same name will always return a reference to the\n",
    "same Logger object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `name` is potentially a period-separated hierarchical value, like\n",
    "`foo.bar.baz` (though it could also be just plain `foo`, for example).\n",
    "Loggers that are further down in the hierarchical list are children of\n",
    "loggers higher up in the list. For example, given a logger with a name\n",
    "of `foo`, loggers with names of `foo.bar`, `foo.bar.baz`, and `foo.bam`\n",
    "are all descendants of `foo`. The logger name hierarchy is analogous to\n",
    "the Python package hierarchy, and identical to it if you organise your\n",
    "loggers on a per-module basis using the recommended construction\n",
    "`logging.getLogger(__name__)`. That's because in a module, `__name__` is\n",
    "the module's name in the Python package namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logger.propagate\n",
    "\n",
    "If this attribute evaluates to true, events logged to this logger will\n",
    "be passed to the handlers of higher level (ancestor) loggers, in\n",
    "addition to any handlers attached to this logger. Messages are passed\n",
    "directly to the ancestor loggers' handlers - neither the level nor\n",
    "filters of the ancestor loggers in question are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this evaluates to false, logging messages are not passed to the\n",
    "handlers of ancestor loggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spelling it out with an example: If the propagate attribute of the\n",
    "logger named `A.B.C` evaluates to true, any event logged to `A.B.C` via\n",
    "a method call such as `logging.getLogger('A.B.C').error(...)` will\n",
    "\\[subject to passing that logger's level and filter settings\\] be passed\n",
    "in turn to any handlers attached to loggers named `A.B`, `A` and the\n",
    "root logger, after first being passed to any handlers attached to\n",
    "`A.B.C`. If any logger in the chain `A.B.C`, `A.B`, `A` has its\n",
    "`propagate` attribute set to false, then that is the last logger whose\n",
    "handlers are offered the event to handle, and propagation stops at that\n",
    "point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor sets this attribute to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "If you attach a handler to a logger *and* one or more of its ancestors,\n",
    "it may emit the same record multiple times. In general, you should not\n",
    "need to attach a handler to more than one logger - if you just attach it\n",
    "to the appropriate logger which is highest in the logger hierarchy, then\n",
    "it will see all events logged by all descendant loggers, provided that\n",
    "their propagate setting is left set to `True`. A common scenario is to\n",
    "attach handlers only to the root logger, and to let propagation take\n",
    "care of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logger.setLevel(level)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets the threshold for this logger to *level*. Logging messages which\n",
    "are less severe than *level* will be ignored; logging messages which\n",
    "have severity *level* or higher will be emitted by whichever handler or\n",
    "handlers service this logger, unless a handler's level has been set to a\n",
    "higher severity level than *level*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a logger is created, the level is set to `NOTSET` (which causes all\n",
    "messages to be processed when the logger is the root logger, or\n",
    "delegation to the parent when the logger is a non-root logger). Note\n",
    "that the root logger is created with level `WARNING`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term 'delegation to the parent' means that if a logger has a level\n",
    "of NOTSET, its chain of ancestor loggers is traversed until either an\n",
    "ancestor with a level other than NOTSET is found, or the root is\n",
    "reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an ancestor is found with a level other than NOTSET, then that\n",
    "ancestor's level is treated as the effective level of the logger where\n",
    "the ancestor search began, and is used to determine how a logging event\n",
    "is handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the root is reached, and it has a level of NOTSET, then all messages\n",
    "will be processed. Otherwise, the root's level will be used as the\n",
    "effective level.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `levels` for a list of levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 The *level* parameter now accepts a string representation of the\n",
    "level such as 'INFO' as an alternative to the integer constants such as\n",
    "`INFO`. Note, however, that levels are internally stored as integers,\n",
    "and methods such as e.g. `getEffectiveLevel` and `isEnabledFor` will\n",
    "return/expect to be passed integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logger.isEnabledFor(level)\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicates if a message of severity *level* would be processed by this\n",
    "logger. This method checks first the module-level level set by\n",
    "`logging.disable(level)` and then the logger's effective level as\n",
    "determined by `getEffectiveLevel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logger.getEffectiveLevel()\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicates the effective level for this logger. If a value other than\n",
    "`NOTSET` has been set using `setLevel`, it is returned. Otherwise, the\n",
    "hierarchy is traversed towards the root until a value other than\n",
    "`NOTSET` is found, and that value is returned. The value returned is an\n",
    "integer, typically one of `logging.DEBUG`, `logging.INFO` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logger.getChild(suffix)\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns a logger which is a descendant to this logger, as determined by\n",
    "the suffix. Thus, `logging.getLogger('abc').getChild('def.ghi')` would\n",
    "return the same logger as would be returned by\n",
    "`logging.getLogger('abc.def.ghi')`. This is a convenience method, useful\n",
    "when the parent logger is named using e.g. `__name__` rather than a\n",
    "literal string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Logger.debug(msg, *args,*\\*kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs a message with level `DEBUG` on this logger. The *msg* is the\n",
    "message format string, and the *args* are the arguments which are merged\n",
    "into *msg* using the string formatting operator. (Note that this means\n",
    "that you can use keywords in the format string, together with a single\n",
    "dictionary argument.) No % formatting operation is performed on *msg*\n",
    "when no *args* are supplied.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four keyword arguments in *kwargs* which are inspected:\n",
    "*exc_info*, *stack_info*, *stacklevel* and *extra*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *exc_info* does not evaluate as false, it causes exception\n",
    "information to be added to the logging message. If an exception tuple\n",
    "(in the format returned by `sys.exc_info`) or an exception instance is\n",
    "provided, it is used; otherwise, `sys.exc_info` is called to get the\n",
    "exception information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second optional keyword argument is *stack_info*, which defaults to\n",
    "`False`. If true, stack information is added to the logging message,\n",
    "including the actual logging call. Note that this is not the same stack\n",
    "information as that displayed through specifying *exc_info*: The former\n",
    "is stack frames from the bottom of the stack up to the logging call in\n",
    "the current thread, whereas the latter is information about stack frames\n",
    "which have been unwound, following an exception, while searching for\n",
    "exception handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify *stack_info* independently of *exc_info*, e.g. to just\n",
    "show how you got to a certain point in your code, even when no\n",
    "exceptions were raised. The stack frames are printed following a header\n",
    "line which says:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` none\n",
    "Stack (most recent call last):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This mimics the `Traceback (most recent call last):` which is used when\n",
    "displaying exception frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third optional keyword argument is *stacklevel*, which defaults to\n",
    "`1`. If greater than 1, the corresponding number of stack frames are\n",
    "skipped when computing the line number and function name set in the\n",
    "`LogRecord` created for the logging event. This can be used in logging\n",
    "helpers so that the function name, filename and line number recorded are\n",
    "not the information for the helper function/method, but rather its\n",
    "caller. The name of this parameter mirrors the equivalent one in the\n",
    "`warnings` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth keyword argument is *extra* which can be used to pass a\n",
    "dictionary which is used to populate the \\_\\_dict\\_\\_ of the `LogRecord`\n",
    "created for the logging event with user-defined attributes. These custom\n",
    "attributes can then be used as you like. For example, they could be\n",
    "incorporated into logged messages. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    FORMAT = '%(asctime)s %(clientip)-15s %(user)-8s %(message)s'\n",
    "    logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT)\n",
    "    d = {'clientip': '192.168.0.1', 'user': 'fbloggs'}\n",
    "    logger = logging.getLogger('tcpserver')\n",
    "    logger.warning('Protocol problem: %s', 'connection reset', extra=d)\n",
    "\n",
    "would print something like\n",
    "\n",
    "``` none\n",
    "2006-02-08 22:20:02,165 192.168.0.1 fbloggs  Protocol problem: connection reset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The keys in the dictionary passed in *extra* should not clash with the\n",
    "keys used by the logging system. (See the `Formatter` documentation for\n",
    "more information on which keys are used by the logging system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to use these attributes in logged messages, you need to\n",
    "exercise some care. In the above example, for instance, the `Formatter`\n",
    "has been set up with a format string which expects 'clientip' and 'user'\n",
    "in the attribute dictionary of the `LogRecord`. If these are missing,\n",
    "the message will not be logged because a string formatting exception\n",
    "will occur. So in this case, you always need to pass the *extra*\n",
    "dictionary with these keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this might be annoying, this feature is intended for use in\n",
    "specialized circumstances, such as multi-threaded servers where the same\n",
    "code executes in many contexts, and interesting conditions which arise\n",
    "are dependent on this context (such as remote client IP address and\n",
    "authenticated user name, in the above example). In such circumstances,\n",
    "it is likely that specialized `Formatter`s would be used with particular\n",
    "`Handler`s.\n",

    "## LoggerAdapter Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "`LoggerAdapter` instances are used to conveniently pass contextual\n",
    "information into logging calls. For a usage example, see the section on\n",
    "`adding contextual information to your logging output <context-info>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns an instance of `LoggerAdapter` initialized with an underlying\n",
    "`Logger` instance and a dict-like object.\n",
    "\n",
    "process(msg, kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifies the message and/or keyword arguments passed to a logging call\n",
    "in order to insert contextual information. This implementation takes the\n",
    "object passed as *extra* to the constructor and adds it to *kwargs*\n",
    "using key 'extra'. The return value is a (*msg*, *kwargs*) tuple which\n",
    "has the (possibly modified) versions of the arguments passed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above, `LoggerAdapter` supports the following methods\n",
    "of `Logger`: `~Logger.debug`, `~Logger.info`, `~Logger.warning`,\n",
    "`~Logger.error`, `~Logger.exception`, `~Logger.critical`, `~Logger.log`,\n",
    "`~Logger.isEnabledFor`, `~Logger.getEffectiveLevel`, `~Logger.setLevel`\n",
    "and `~Logger.hasHandlers`. These methods have the same signatures as\n",
    "their counterparts in `Logger`, so you can use the two types of\n",
    "instances interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 The `~Logger.isEnabledFor`, `~Logger.getEffectiveLevel`,\n",
    "`~Logger.setLevel` and `~Logger.hasHandlers` methods were added to\n",
    "`LoggerAdapter`. These methods delegate to the underlying logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 Attribute `manager` and method `_log` were added, which delegate to\n",
    "the underlying logger and allow adapters to be nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thread Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging module is intended to be thread-safe without any special\n",
    "work needing to be done by its clients. It achieves this though using\n",
    "threading locks; there is one lock to serialize access to the module's\n",
    "shared data, and each handler also creates a lock to serialize access to\n",
    "its underlying I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are implementing asynchronous signal handlers using the `signal`\n",
    "module, you may not be able to use logging from within such handlers.\n",
    "This is because lock implementations in the `threading` module are not\n",
    "always re-entrant, and so cannot be invoked from such signal handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module-Level Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the classes described above, there are a number of\n",
    "module-level functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "getLogger(name=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a logger with the specified name or, if name is `None`, return a\n",
    "logger which is the root logger of the hierarchy. If specified, the name\n",
    "is typically a dot-separated hierarchical name like *'a'*, *'a.b'* or\n",
    "*'a.b.c.d'*. Choice of these names is entirely up to the developer who\n",
    "is using logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "All calls to this function with a given name return the same logger\n",
    "instance. This means that logger instances never need to be passed\n",
    "between different parts of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "getLoggerClass()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return either the standard `Logger` class, or the last class passed to\n",
    "`setLoggerClass`. This function may be called from within a new class\n",
    "definition, to ensure that installing a customized `Logger` class will\n",
    "not undo customizations already applied by other code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyLogger(logging.getLoggerClass()):\n",
    "        # ... override behaviour here\n",
    "\n",
    "getLogRecordFactory()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a callable which is used to create a `LogRecord`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 This function has been provided, along with `setLogRecordFactory`,\n",
    "to allow developers more control over how the `LogRecord` representing a\n",
    "logging event is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `setLogRecordFactory` for more information about the how the factory\n",
    "is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "debug(msg, *args,*\\*kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Logs a message with level `DEBUG` on the root logger. The *msg* is the\n",
    "message format string, and the *args* are the arguments which are merged\n",
    "into *msg* using the string formatting operator. (Note that this means\n",
    "that you can use keywords in the format string, together with a single\n",
    "dictionary argument.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three keyword arguments in *kwargs* which are inspected:\n",
    "*exc_info* which, if it does not evaluate as false, causes exception\n",
    "information to be added to the logging message. If an exception tuple\n",
    "(in the format returned by `sys.exc_info`) or an exception instance is\n",
    "provided, it is used; otherwise, `sys.exc_info` is called to get the\n",
    "exception information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second optional keyword argument is *stack_info*, which defaults to\n",
    "`False`. If true, stack information is added to the logging message,\n",
    "including the actual logging call. Note that this is not the same stack\n",
    "information as that displayed through specifying *exc_info*: The former\n",
    "is stack frames from the bottom of the stack up to the logging call in\n",
    "the current thread, whereas the latter is information about stack frames\n",
    "which have been unwound, following an exception, while searching for\n",
    "exception handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify *stack_info* independently of *exc_info*, e.g. to just\n",
    "show how you got to a certain point in your code, even when no\n",
    "exceptions were raised. The stack frames are printed following a header\n",
    "line which says:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` none\n",
    "Stack (most recent call last):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This mimics the `Traceback (most recent call last):` which is used when\n",
    "displaying exception frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third optional keyword argument is *extra* which can be used to pass\n",
    "a dictionary which is used to populate the \\_\\_dict\\_\\_ of the LogRecord\n",
    "created for the logging event with user-defined attributes. These custom\n",
    "attributes can then be used as you like. For example, they could be\n",
    "incorporated into logged messages. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    FORMAT = '%(asctime)s %(clientip)-15s %(user)-8s %(message)s'\n",
    "    logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT)\n",

    "    logging.warning('Protocol problem: %s', 'connection reset', extra=d)\n",
    "\n",
    "would print something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` none\n",
    "2006-02-08 22:20:02,165 192.168.0.1 fbloggs  Protocol problem: connection reset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The keys in the dictionary passed in *extra* should not clash with the\n",
    "keys used by the logging system. (See the `Formatter` documentation for\n",
    "more information on which keys are used by the logging system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to use these attributes in logged messages, you need to\n",
    "exercise some care. In the above example, for instance, the `Formatter`\n",
    "has been set up with a format string which expects 'clientip' and 'user'\n",
    "in the attribute dictionary of the LogRecord. If these are missing, the\n",
    "message will not be logged because a string formatting exception will\n",
    "occur. So in this case, you always need to pass the *extra* dictionary\n",
    "with these keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this might be annoying, this feature is intended for use in\n",
    "specialized circumstances, such as multi-threaded servers where the same\n",
    "code executes in many contexts, and interesting conditions which arise\n",
    "are dependent on this context (such as remote client IP address and\n",
    "authenticated user name, in the above example). In such circumstances,\n",
    "it is likely that specialized `Formatter`s would be used with particular\n",
    "`Handler`s.\n",

    "this function can be useful. Its effect is to disable all logging calls\n",
    "of severity *level* and below, so that if you call it with a value of\n",
    "INFO, then all INFO and DEBUG events would be discarded, whereas those\n",
    "of severity WARNING and above would be processed according to the\n",
