    "\n",
    "The `pty` module defines operations for handling the pseudo-terminal\n",
    "concept: starting another process and being able to write to and read\n",
    "from its controlling terminal programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-terminal handling is highly platform dependent. This code is\n",
    "mainly tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS (it is supposed to work on\n",
    "other POSIX platforms but it's not been thoroughly tested).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pty` module defines the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "fork()\n",
    "\n",
    "Fork. Connect the child's controlling terminal to a pseudo-terminal.\n",
    "Return value is `(pid, fd)`. Note that the child gets *pid* 0, and the\n",
    "*fd* is *invalid*. The parent's return value is the *pid* of the child,\n",
    "and *fd* is a file descriptor connected to the child's controlling\n",
    "terminal (and also to the child's standard input and output).\n",
    "\n",
    "openpty()\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a new pseudo-terminal pair, using `os.openpty` if possible, or\n",
    "emulation code for generic Unix systems. Return a pair of file\n",
    "descriptors `(master, slave)`, for the master and the slave end,\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "spawn(argv\\[, master_read\\[, stdin_read\\]\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current\n",
    "process's standard io. This is often used to baffle programs which\n",
    "insist on reading from the controlling terminal. It is expected that the\n",
    "process spawned behind the pty will eventually terminate, and when it\n",
    "does *spawn* will return.\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop copies STDIN of the current process to the child and data\n",
    "received from the child to STDOUT of the current process. It is not\n",
    "signaled to the child if STDIN of the current process closes down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions *master_read* and *stdin_read* are passed a file\n",
    "descriptor which they should read from, and they should always return a\n",
    "byte string. In order to force spawn to return before the child process\n",
    "exits an empty byte array should be returned to signal end of file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default implementation for both functions will read and return up to\n",
    "1024 bytes each time the function is called. The *master_read* callback\n",
    "is passed the pseudoterminalâ€™s master file descriptor to read output\n",
    "from the child process, and *stdin_read* is passed file descriptor 0, to\n",
    "read from the parent process's standard input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning an empty byte string from either callback is interpreted as an\n",
    "end-of-file (EOF) condition, and that callback will not be called after\n",
    "that. If *stdin_read* signals EOF the controlling terminal can no longer\n",
    "communicate with the parent process OR the child process. Unless the\n",
    "child process will quit without any input, *spawn* will then loop\n",
    "forever. If *master_read* signals EOF the same behavior results (on\n",
    "linux at least).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the exit status value from `os.waitpid` on the child process.\n",
    "\n",
    "`waitstatus_to_exitcode` can be used to convert the exit status into an\n",
