    "\n",
    "-   The address of an `AF_UNIX` socket bound to a file system node is\n",
    "    represented as a string, using the file system encoding and the\n",

    "    initial null byte; note that sockets in this namespace can\n",
    "    communicate with normal file system sockets, so programs intended to\n",
    "    run on Linux may need to deal with both types of address. A string\n",
    "    or bytes-like object can be used for either type of address when\n",
    "    passing it as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.3 Previously, `AF_UNIX` socket paths were assumed to use UTF-8\n",

    "-   In *non-blocking mode*, operations fail (with an error that is\n",
    "    unfortunately system-dependent) if they cannot be completed\n",
    "    immediately: functions from the `select` can be used to know when\n",
    "    and whether a socket is available for reading or writing.\n",
    "-   In *timeout mode*, operations fail if they cannot be completed\n",
    "    within the timeout specified for the socket (they raise a `timeout`\n",
    "    exception) or if the system returns an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "At the operating system level, sockets in *timeout mode* are internally\n",
    "set in non-blocking mode. Also, the blocking and timeout modes are\n",
    "shared between file descriptors and socket objects that refer to the\n",

    "### Timeouts and the `connect` method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `~socket.connect` operation is also subject to the timeout setting,\n",
    "and in general it is recommended to call `~socket.settimeout` before\n",
    "calling `~socket.connect` or pass a timeout parameter to\n",

    "    the socket returned by `~socket.accept` is in *blocking mode*;\n",
    "-   if the listening socket is in *non-blocking mode*, whether the\n",
    "    socket returned by `~socket.accept` is in blocking or non-blocking\n",
    "    mode is operating system-dependent. If you want to ensure\n",
