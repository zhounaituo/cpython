    "## Custom String Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in string class provides the ability to do complex variable\n",
    "substitutions and value formatting via the `~str.format` method\n",
    "described in `3101`. The `Formatter` class in the `string` module allows\n",
    "you to create and customize your own string formatting behaviors using\n",
    "the same implementation as the built-in `~str.format` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Formatter` class has the following public methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "format(format_string, /, *args,*\\*kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary API method. It takes a format string and an arbitrary set of\n",
    "positional and keyword arguments. It is just a wrapper that calls\n",
    "`vformat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 A format string argument is now `positional-only\n",
    "<positional-only_parameter>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "vformat(format_string, args, kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function does the actual work of formatting. It is exposed as a\n",
    "separate function for cases where you want to pass in a predefined\n",
    "dictionary of arguments, rather than unpacking and repacking the\n",
    "dictionary as individual arguments using the `*args` and `**kwargs`\n",
    "syntax. `vformat` does the work of breaking up the format string into\n",
    "character data and replacement fields. It calls the various methods\n",
    "described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the `Formatter` defines a number of methods that are\n",
    "intended to be replaced by subclasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "parse(format_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop over the format_string and return an iterable of tuples\n",
    "(*literal_text*, *field_name*, *format_spec*, *conversion*). This is\n",
    "used by `vformat` to break the string into either literal text, or\n",
    "replacement fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values in the tuple conceptually represent a span of literal text\n",
    "followed by a single replacement field. If there is no literal text\n",
    "(which can happen if two replacement fields occur consecutively), then\n",
    "*literal_text* will be a zero-length string. If there is no replacement\n",
    "field, then the values of *field_name*, *format_spec* and *conversion*\n",
    "will be `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "get_field(field_name, args, kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given *field_name* as returned by `parse` (see above), convert it to an\n",
    "object to be formatted. Returns a tuple (obj, used_key). The default\n",
    "version takes strings of the form defined in `3101`, such as \"0\\[name\\]\"\n",
    "or \"label.title\". *args* and *kwargs* are as passed in to `vformat`. The\n",
    "return value *used_key* has the same meaning as the *key* parameter to\n",
    "`get_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "get_value(key, args, kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieve a given field value. The *key* argument will be either an\n",
    "integer or a string. If it is an integer, it represents the index of the\n",
    "positional argument in *args*; if it is a string, then it represents a\n",
    "named argument in *kwargs*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *args* parameter is set to the list of positional arguments to\n",
    "`vformat`, and the *kwargs* parameter is set to the dictionary of\n",
    "keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For compound field names, these functions are only called for the first\n",
    "component of the field name; subsequent components are handled through\n",
    "normal attribute and indexing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, the field expression '0.name' would cause `get_value` to\n",
    "be called with a *key* argument of 0. The `name` attribute will be\n",
    "looked up after `get_value` returns by calling the built-in `getattr`\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an\n",
    "`IndexError` or `KeyError` should be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "check_unused_args(used_args, args, kwargs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement checking for unused arguments if desired. The arguments to\n",
    "this function is the set of all argument keys that were actually\n",
    "referred to in the format string (integers for positional arguments, and\n",
    "strings for named arguments), and a reference to the *args* and *kwargs*\n",
    "that was passed to vformat. The set of unused args can be calculated\n",
    "from these parameters. `check_unused_args` is assumed to raise an\n",
    "exception if the check fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "format_field(value, format_spec)\n",
    "\n",
    "`format_field` simply calls the global `format` built-in. The method is\n",
    "provided so that subclasses can override it.\n",
    "\n",
    "convert_field(value, conversion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts the value (returned by `get_field`) given a conversion type (as\n",
    "in the tuple returned by the `parse` method). The default version\n",
    "understands 's' (str), 'r' (repr) and 'a' (ascii) conversion types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Format String Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str.format` method and the `Formatter` class share the same syntax\n",
    "for format strings (although in the case of `Formatter`, subclasses can\n",
    "define their own format string syntax). The syntax is related to that of\n",
    "`formatted string literals <f-strings>`, but it is less sophisticated\n",
    "and, in particular, does not support arbitrary expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: {} (curly brackets); in string formatting single: . (dot); in\n",
    "string formatting single: \\[\\] (square brackets); in string formatting\n",
    "single: ! (exclamation); in string formatting single: : (colon); in\n",
    "string formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "Format strings contain \"replacement fields\" surrounded by curly braces\n",
    "`{}`. Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal\n",
    "text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you need to include a\n",
    "brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: `{{`\n",
    "and `}}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar for a replacement field is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> format-string replacement_field: \"{\" \\[<span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">field_name</span>\\] \\[\"!\" <span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">conversion</span>\\] \\[\":\" <span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">format_spec</span>\\] \"}\" field_name: arg_name (\".\"\n",
    "> <span class=\"title-ref\">attribute_name</span> \\| \"\\[\" <span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">element_index</span> \"\\]\")\\* arg_name: \\[<span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">identifier</span> \\| <span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">digit</span>+\\] attribute_name: <span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">identifier</span> element_index: <span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">digit</span>+ \\| <span\n",
    "> class=\"title-ref\">index_string</span> index_string: \\<any source\n",
    "> character except \"\\]\"\\> + conversion: \"r\" \\| \"s\" \\| \"a\" format_spec:\n",
    "> \\<described in the next section\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "In less formal terms, the replacement field can start with a\n",
    "*field_name* that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted\n",
    "and inserted into the output instead of the replacement field. The\n",
    "*field_name* is optionally followed by a *conversion* field, which is\n",
    "preceded by an exclamation point `'!'`, and a *format_spec*, which is\n",
    "preceded by a colon `':'`. These specify a non-default format for the\n",
    "replacement value.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also the `formatspec` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *field_name* itself begins with an *arg_name* that is either a\n",
    "number or a keyword. If it's a number, it refers to a positional\n",
    "argument, and if it's a keyword, it refers to a named keyword argument.\n",
    "If the numerical arg_names in a format string are 0, 1, 2, ... in\n",
    "sequence, they can all be omitted (not just some) and the numbers 0, 1,\n",
    "2, ... will be automatically inserted in that order. Because *arg_name*\n",
    "is not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary\n",
    "dictionary keys (e.g., the strings `'10'` or `':-]'`) within a format\n",
    "string. The *arg_name* can be followed by any number of index or\n",
    "attribute expressions. An expression of the form `'.name'` selects the\n",
    "named attribute using `getattr`, while an expression of the form\n",
    "`'[index]'` does an index lookup using `__getitem__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 The positional argument specifiers can be omitted for `str.format`,\n",
    "so `'{} {}'.format(a, b)` is equivalent to `'{0} {1}'.format(a, b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 The positional argument specifiers can be omitted for `Formatter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some simple format string examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"First, thou shalt count to {0}\"  # References first positional argument\n",
    "    \"Bring me a {}\"                   # Implicitly references the first positional argument\n",
    "    \"From {} to {}\"                   # Same as \"From {0} to {1}\"\n",
    "    \"My quest is {name}\"              # References keyword argument 'name'\n",
    "    \"Weight in tons {0.weight}\"       # 'weight' attribute of first positional arg\n",
    "    \"Units destroyed: {players[0]}\"   # First element of keyword argument 'players'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *conversion* field causes a type coercion before formatting.\n",
    "Normally, the job of formatting a value is done by the `__format__`\n",
    "method of the value itself. However, in some cases it is desirable to\n",
    "force a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own definition\n",
    "of formatting. By converting the value to a string before calling\n",
    "`__format__`, the normal formatting logic is bypassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three conversion flags are currently supported: `'!s'` which calls `str`\n",
    "on the value, `'!r'` which calls `repr` and `'!a'` which calls `ascii`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Harold's a clever {0!s}\"        # Calls str() on the argument first\n",
    "    \"Bring out the holy {name!r}\"    # Calls repr() on the argument first\n",
    "    \"More {!a}\"                      # Calls ascii() on the argument first\n",
    "\n",
    "The *format_spec* field contains a specification of how the value should\n",
    "be presented, including such details as field width, alignment, padding,\n",
    "decimal precision and so on. Each value type can define its own\n",
    "\"formatting mini-language\" or interpretation of the *format_spec*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most built-in types support a common formatting mini-language, which is\n",
    "described in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *format_spec* field can also include nested replacement fields within\n",
    "it. These nested replacement fields may contain a field name, conversion\n",
    "flag and format specification, but deeper nesting is not allowed. The\n",
    "replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted before the\n",
    "*format_spec* string is interpreted. This allows the formatting of a\n",
    "value to be dynamically specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the `formatexamples` section for some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format Specification Mini-Language\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Format specifications\" are used within replacement fields contained\n",
    "within a format string to define how individual values are presented\n",
    "(see `formatstrings` and `f-strings`). They can also be passed directly\n",
    "to the built-in `format` function. Each formattable type may define how\n",
    "the format specification is to be interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most built-in types implement the following options for format\n",
    "specifications, although some of the formatting options are only\n",
    "supported by the numeric types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general convention is that an empty format specification produces the\n",
    "same result as if you had called `str` on the value. A non-empty format\n",
    "specification typically modifies the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of a *standard format specifier* is:\n",
    "\n",
    "format-spec format_spec: \\[\\[<span class=\"title-ref\">fill</span>\\]<span\n",
