    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept of\n",
    "cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple\n",
    "string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any\n",
    "serializable data-type as cookie value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the\n",
    "`2109` and `2068` specifications. It has since been discovered that MSIE\n",
    "3.0x doesn't follow the character rules outlined in those specs and also\n",
    "many current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing rules when\n",
    "comes to Cookie handling. As a result, the parsing rules used are a bit\n",
    "less strict.\n",
    "\n",
    "The character set, `string.ascii_letters`, `string.digits` and\n",
    "`` !#$%&'*+-.^_`|~: `` denote the set of valid characters allowed by\n",
    "this module in Cookie name (as `~Morsel.key`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Allowed ':' as a valid Cookie name character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "On encountering an invalid cookie, `CookieError` is raised, so if your\n",
    "cookie data comes from a browser you should always prepare for invalid\n",
    "data and catch `CookieError` on parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "CookieError\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception failing because of `2109` invalidity: incorrect attributes,\n",
    "incorrect `Set-Cookie` header, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is a dictionary-like object whose keys are strings and whose\n",
    "values are `Morsel` instances. Note that upon setting a key to a value,\n",
    "the value is first converted to a `Morsel` containing the key and the\n",
    "value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *input* is given, it is passed to the `load` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class derives from `BaseCookie` and overrides `value_decode` and\n",
    "`value_encode`. SimpleCookie supports strings as cookie values. When\n",
    "setting the value, SimpleCookie calls the builtin `str()` to convert the\n",
    "value to a string. Values received from HTTP are kept as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module `http.cookiejar`  \n",
    "HTTP cookie handling for web *clients*. The `http.cookiejar` and\n",
    "`http.cookies` modules do not depend on each other.\n",

    "`coded_value` will always be converted to a string. This method does no\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, it should be the case that `value_encode` and `value_decode`\n",

    "Return a string representation suitable to be sent as HTTP headers.\n",
    "*attrs* and *header* are sent to each `Morsel`'s `output` method. *sep*\n",

    "\n",
    "The attribute `samesite` specifies that the browser is not allowed to\n",
