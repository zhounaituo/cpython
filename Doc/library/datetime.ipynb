    "## Aware and Naive Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Date and time objects may be categorized as \"aware\" or \"naive\" depending\n",
    "on whether or not they include timezone information.\n",
    "\n",
    "With sufficient knowledge of applicable algorithmic and political time\n",
    "adjustments, such as time zone and daylight saving time information, an\n",
    "**aware** object can locate itself relative to other aware objects. An\n",
    "aware object represents a specific moment in time that is not open to\n",
    "interpretation.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "A **naive** object does not contain enough information to unambiguously\n",
    "locate itself relative to other date/time objects. Whether a naive\n",
    "object represents Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), local time, or time\n",
    "in some other timezone is purely up to the program, just like it is up\n",
    "to the program whether a particular number represents metres, miles, or\n",
    "mass. Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with, at the cost\n",
    "of ignoring some aspects of reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For applications requiring aware objects, `.datetime` and `.time`\n",
    "objects have an optional time zone information attribute, `!tzinfo`,\n",
    "that can be set to an instance of a subclass of the abstract `tzinfo`\n",
    "class. These `tzinfo` objects capture information about the offset from\n",
    "UTC time, the time zone name, and whether daylight saving time is in\n",
    "effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one concrete `tzinfo` class, the `timezone` class, is supplied by\n",
    "the `datetime` module. The `timezone` class can represent simple\n",
    "timezones with fixed offsets from UTC, such as UTC itself or North\n",
    "American EST and EDT timezones. Supporting timezones at deeper levels of\n",
    "detail is up to the application. The rules for time adjustment across\n",
    "the world are more political than rational, change frequently, and there\n",
    "is no standard suitable for every application aside from UTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "The `datetime` module exports the following constants:\n",
    "\n",
    "MINYEAR\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest year number allowed in a `date` or `.datetime` object.\n",
    "`MINYEAR` is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAXYEAR\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest year number allowed in a `date` or `.datetime` object.\n",
    "`MAXYEAR` is `9999`.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTC\n",
    "\n",
    "Alias for the UTC timezone singleton `datetime.timezone.utc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.11\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Types\n",
    "\n",
    "An idealized naive date, assuming the current Gregorian calendar always\n",
    "was, and always will be, in effect. Attributes: `year`, `month`, and\n",
    "`day`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An idealized time, independent of any particular day, assuming that\n",
    "every day has exactly 24\\*60\\*60 seconds. (There is no notion of \"leap\n",
    "seconds\" here.) Attributes: `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `microsecond`,\n",
    "and `.tzinfo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of a date and a time. Attributes: `year`, `month`, `day`,\n",
    "`hour`, `minute`, `second`, `microsecond`, and `.tzinfo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A duration expressing the difference between two `date`, `.time`, or\n",
    "`.datetime` instances to microsecond resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract base class for time zone information objects. These are used\n",
    "by the `.datetime` and `.time` classes to provide a customizable notion\n",
    "of time adjustment (for example, to account for time zone and/or\n",
    "daylight saving time).\n",
    "\n",
    "A class that implements the `tzinfo` abstract base class as a fixed\n",
    "offset from the UTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects of these types are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclass relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "    object\n",
    "        timedelta\n",
    "        tzinfo\n",
    "            timezone\n",
    "        time\n",
    "        date\n",
    "            datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The `date`, `.datetime`, `.time`, and `timezone` types share these\n",
    "common features:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Objects of these types are immutable.\n",
    "-   Objects of these types are hashable, meaning that they can be used\n",
    "    as dictionary keys.\n",
    "-   Objects of these types support efficient pickling via the `pickle`\n",
    "    module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining if an Object is Aware or Naive\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects of the `date` type are always naive.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object of type `.time` or `.datetime` may be aware or naive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `.datetime` object *d* is aware if both of the following hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `d.tzinfo` is not `None`\n",
    "2.  `d.tzinfo.utcoffset(d)` does not return `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, *d* is naive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `.time` object *t* is aware if both of the following hold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `t.tzinfo` is not `None`\n",
    "2.  `t.tzinfo.utcoffset(None)` does not return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, *t* is naive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between aware and naive doesn't apply to `timedelta`\n",
    "objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `timedelta` Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A `timedelta` object represents a duration, the difference between two\n",
    "dates or times.\n",
    "\n",
    "All arguments are optional and default to `0`. Arguments may be integers\n",
    "or floats, and may be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only *days*, *seconds* and *microseconds* are stored internally.\n",
    "Arguments are converted to those units:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A millisecond is converted to 1000 microseconds.\n",
    "-   A minute is converted to 60 seconds.\n",
    "-   An hour is converted to 3600 seconds.\n",
    "-   A week is converted to 7 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "and days, seconds and microseconds are then normalized so that the\n",
    "representation is unique, with\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `0 <= microseconds < 1000000`\n",
    "-   `0 <= seconds < 3600*24` (the number of seconds in one day)\n",
    "-   `-999999999 <= days <= 999999999`\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example illustrates how any arguments besides *days*,\n",
    "*seconds* and *microseconds* are \"merged\" and normalized into those\n",
    "three resulting attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> from datetime import timedelta\n",
