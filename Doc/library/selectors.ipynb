    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This module allows high-level and efficient I/O multiplexing, built upon\n",
    "the `select` module primitives. Users are encouraged to use this module\n",
    "instead, unless they want precise control over the OS-level primitives\n",
    "used.\n",
    "\n",
    "It defines a `BaseSelector` abstract base class, along with several\n",
    "concrete implementations (`KqueueSelector`, `EpollSelector`...), that\n",
    "can be used to wait for I/O readiness notification on multiple file\n",
    "objects. In the following, \"file object\" refers to any object with a\n",
    "`fileno()` method, or a raw file descriptor. See `file object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`DefaultSelector` is an alias to the most efficient implementation\n",
    "available on the current platform: this should be the default choice for\n",
    "most users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of file objects supported depends on the platform: on Windows,\n",
    "sockets are supported, but not pipes, whereas on Unix, both are\n",
    "supported (some other types may be supported as well, such as fifos or\n",
    "special file devices).\n",

    "A `BaseSelector` is used to wait for I/O event readiness on multiple\n",
