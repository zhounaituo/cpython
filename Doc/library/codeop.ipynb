    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python\n",
    "read-eval-print loop can be emulated, as is done in the `code` module.\n",
    "As a result, you probably don't want to use the module directly; if you\n",
    "want to include such a loop in your program you probably want to use the\n",
    "`code` module instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to this job:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Being able to tell if a line of input completes a Python statement:\n",
    "    in short, telling whether to print '`>>>`' or '`...`' next.\n",
    "2.  Remembering which future statements the user has entered, so\n",
    "    subsequent input can be compiled with these in effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `codeop` module provides a way of doing each of these things, and a\n",
    "way of doing them both.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do just the former:\n",
    "\n",
    "compile_command(source, filename=\"\\<input\\>\", symbol=\"single\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Tries to compile *source*, which should be a string of Python code and\n",
    "return a code object if *source* is valid Python code. In that case, the\n",
    "filename attribute of the code object will be *filename*, which defaults\n",
    "to `'<input>'`. Returns `None` if *source* is *not* valid Python code,\n",
    "but is a prefix of valid Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a problem with *source*, an exception will be raised.\n",
    "`SyntaxError` is raised if there is invalid Python syntax, and\n",
    "`OverflowError` or `ValueError` if there is an invalid literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *symbol* argument determines whether *source* is compiled as a\n",
    "statement (`'single'`, the default), as a sequence of statements\n",
    "(`'exec'`) or as an `expression` (`'eval'`). Any other value will cause\n",
    "`ValueError` to be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a\n",
    "successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this case,\n",
    "trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error. For\n",
    "example, a backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by\n",
    "arbitrary garbage. This will be fixed once the API for the parser is\n",
    "better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instances of this class have `__call__` methods identical in signature\n",
    "to the built-in function `compile`, but with the difference that if the\n",
    "instance compiles program text containing a `__future__` statement, the\n",
    "instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts with the\n",
    "statement in force.\n",
