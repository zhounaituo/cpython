    "The `subprocess` module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to\n",
    "their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. This\n",

    "## Using the `subprocess` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended approach to invoking subprocesses is to use the `run`\n",
    "function for all use cases it can handle. For more advanced use cases,\n",
    "the underlying `Popen` interface can be used directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "run(args, *, stdin=None, input=None, stdout=None,\n",
    "stderr=None,capture_output=False, shell=False, cwd=None, timeout=None,\n",

    "\n",
    "Run the command described by *args*. Wait for command to complete, then\n",
    "return a `CompletedProcess` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arguments shown above are merely the most common ones, described\n",
    "below in `frequently-used-arguments` (hence the use of keyword-only\n",
    "notation in the abbreviated signature). The full function signature is\n",
    "largely the same as that of the `Popen` constructor - most of the\n",
    "arguments to this function are passed through to that interface.\n",
    "(*timeout*, *input*, *check*, and *capture_output* are not.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If *capture_output* is true, stdout and stderr will be captured. When\n",
    "used, the internal `Popen` object is automatically created with\n",
    "`stdout=PIPE` and `stderr=PIPE`. The *stdout* and *stderr* arguments may\n",
    "not be supplied at the same time as *capture_output*. If you wish to\n",
    "capture and combine both streams into one, use `stdout=PIPE` and\n",
    "`stderr=STDOUT` instead of *capture_output*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *timeout* argument is passed to `Popen.communicate`. If the timeout\n",
    "expires, the child process will be killed and waited for. The\n",
    "`TimeoutExpired` exception will be re-raised after the child process has\n",
    "terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *input* argument is passed to `Popen.communicate` and thus to the\n",
    "subprocess's stdin. If used it must be a byte sequence, or a string if\n",
    "*encoding* or *errors* is specified or *text* is true. When used, the\n",
    "internal `Popen` object is automatically created with `stdin=PIPE`, and\n",
    "the *stdin* argument may not be used as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *check* is true, and the process exits with a non-zero exit code, a\n",
    "`CalledProcessError` exception will be raised. Attributes of that\n",
    "exception hold the arguments, the exit code, and stdout and stderr if\n",
    "they were captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *encoding* or *errors* are specified, or *text* is true, file objects\n",
    "for stdin, stdout and stderr are opened in text mode using the specified\n",
    "*encoding* and *errors* or the `io.TextIOWrapper` default. The\n",
    "*universal_newlines* argument is equivalent to *text* and is provided\n",
    "for backwards compatibility. By default, file objects are opened in\n",
    "binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *env* is not `None`, it must be a mapping that defines the\n",
    "environment variables for the new process; these are used instead of the\n",

    "To support a wide variety of use cases, the `Popen` constructor (and the\n",
    "convenience functions) accept a large number of optional arguments. For\n",
    "most typical use cases, many of these arguments can be safely left at\n",
    "their default values. The arguments that are most commonly needed are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *args* is required for all calls and should be a string, or a sequence\n",
    "> of program arguments. Providing a sequence of arguments is generally\n",
    "> preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required\n",
    "> escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file\n",
    "> names). If passing a single string, either *shell* must be `True` (see\n",
    "> below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed\n",
    "> without specifying any arguments.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *stdin*, *stdout* and *stderr* specify the executed program's standard\n",
    "> input, standard output and standard error file handles, respectively.\n",
    "> Valid values are `PIPE`, `DEVNULL`, an existing file descriptor (a\n",
    "> positive integer), an existing file object with a valid file\n",
    "> descriptor, and `None`. `PIPE` indicates that a new pipe to the child\n",
    "> should be created. `DEVNULL` indicates that the special file\n",
    "> `os.devnull` will be used. With the default settings of `None`, no\n",
    "> redirection will occur; the child's file handles will be inherited\n",
    "> from the parent. Additionally, *stderr* can be `STDOUT`, which\n",
    "> indicates that the stderr data from the child process should be\n",
    "> captured into the same file handle as for *stdout*.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> single: universal newlines; subprocess module\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If *encoding* or *errors* are specified, or *text* (also known as\n",
    "> *universal_newlines*) is true, the file objects *stdin*, *stdout* and\n",
    "> *stderr* will be opened in text mode using the *encoding* and *errors*\n",

    "These options, along with all of the other options, are described in\n",
    "more detail in the `Popen` constructor documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popen Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying process creation and management in this module is handled\n",
    "by the `Popen` class. It offers a lot of flexibility so that developers\n",
    "are able to handle the less common cases not covered by the convenience\n",
    "functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute a child program in a new process. On POSIX, the class uses\n",
    "`os.execvpe`-like behavior to execute the child program. On Windows, the\n",
    "class uses the Windows `CreateProcess()` function. The arguments to\n",
    "`Popen` are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "*args* should be a sequence of program arguments or else a single string\n",
    "or `path-like object`. By default, the program to execute is the first\n",
    "item in *args* if *args* is a sequence. If *args* is a string, the\n",
    "interpretation is platform-dependent and described below. See the\n",
    "*shell* and *executable* arguments for additional differences from the\n",
    "default behavior. Unless otherwise stated, it is recommended to pass\n",
    "*args* as a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "For maximum reliability, use a fully-qualified path for the executable.\n",
    "To search for an unqualified name on `PATH`, use `shutil.which`. On all\n",
    "platforms, passing `sys.executable` is the recommended way to launch the\n",
    "current Python interpreter again, and use the `-m` command-line format\n",
    "to launch an installed module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolving the path of *executable* (or the first item of *args*) is\n",
    "platform dependent. For POSIX, see `os.execvpe`, and note that when\n",
    "resolving or searching for the executable path, *cwd* overrides the\n",
    "current working directory and *env* can override the `PATH` environment\n",
    "variable. For Windows, see the documentation of the `lpApplicationName`\n",
    "and `lpCommandLine` parameters of WinAPI `CreateProcess`, and note that\n",
    "when resolving or searching for the executable path with `shell=False`,\n",
    "*cwd* does not override the current working directory and *env* cannot\n",
    "override the `PATH` environment variable. Using a full path avoids all\n",
    "of these variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of passing some arguments to an external program as a\n",
    "sequence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Popen([\"/usr/bin/git\", \"commit\", \"-m\", \"Fixes a bug.\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "On POSIX, if *args* is a string, the string is interpreted as the name\n",
    "or path of the program to execute. However, this can only be done if not\n",
    "passing arguments to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be obvious how to break a shell command into a sequence of\n",
    "arguments, especially in complex cases. `shlex.split` can illustrate how\n",
    "to determine the correct tokenization for *args*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import shlex, subprocess\n",
    "    >>> command_line = input()\n",
    "    /bin/vikings -input eggs.txt -output \"spam spam.txt\" -cmd \"echo '$MONEY'\"\n",
    "    >>> args = shlex.split(command_line)\n",
    "    >>> print(args)\n",
    "    ['/bin/vikings', '-input', 'eggs.txt', '-output', 'spam spam.txt', '-cmd', \"echo '$MONEY'\"]\n",
    "    >>> p = subprocess.Popen(args) # Success!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note in particular that options (such as *-input*) and arguments (such\n",
    "as *eggs.txt*) that are separated by whitespace in the shell go in\n",
    "separate list elements, while arguments that need quoting or backslash\n",
    "escaping when used in the shell (such as filenames containing spaces or\n",
    "the *echo* command shown above) are single list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, if *args* is a sequence, it will be converted to a string in\n",
    "a manner described in `converting-argument-sequence`. This is because\n",
    "the underlying `CreateProcess()` operates on strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 *args* parameter accepts a `path-like object` if *shell* is `False`\n",
    "and a sequence containing path-like objects on POSIX.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.8 *args* parameter accepts a `path-like object` if *shell* is `False`\n",
    "and a sequence containing bytes and path-like objects on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *shell* argument (which defaults to `False`) specifies whether to\n",
    "use the shell as the program to execute. If *shell* is `True`, it is\n",
    "recommended to pass *args* as a string rather than as a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "On POSIX with `shell=True`, the shell defaults to `/bin/sh`. If *args*\n",
    "is a string, the string specifies the command to execute through the\n",
    "shell. This means that the string must be formatted exactly as it would\n",
    "be when typed at the shell prompt. This includes, for example, quoting\n",
    "or backslash escaping filenames with spaces in them. If *args* is a\n",
    "sequence, the first item specifies the command string, and any\n",
    "additional items will be treated as additional arguments to the shell\n",
    "itself. That is to say, `Popen` does the equivalent of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Popen(['/bin/sh', '-c', args[0], args[1], ...])\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows with `shell=True`, the `COMSPEC` environment variable\n",
    "specifies the default shell. The only time you need to specify\n",
    "`shell=True` on Windows is when the command you wish to execute is built\n",
    "into the shell (e.g. `dir` or `copy`). You do not need `shell=True` to\n",
    "run a batch file or console-based executable.\n",
