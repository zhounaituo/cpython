    "over the more common approach. The module is called `bisect` because it\n",

    "\n",
    "When writing time sensitive code using *bisect()* and *insort()*, keep\n",
    "these thoughts in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Bisection is effective for searching ranges of values. For locating\n",
    "    specific values, dictionaries are more performant.\n",
    "-   The *insort()* functions are `O(n)` because the logarithmic search\n",
    "    step is dominated by the linear time insertion step.\n",
    "-   The search functions are stateless and discard key function results\n",
    "    after they are used. Consequently, if the search functions are used\n",
    "    in a loop, the key function may be called again and again on the\n",
    "    same array elements. If the key function isn't fast, consider\n",
    "    wrapping it with `functools.cache` to avoid duplicate computations.\n",
    "    Alternatively, consider searching an array of precomputed keys to\n",
    "    locate the insertion point (as shown in the examples section below).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Sorted\n",
    "    Collections](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcollections/) is a\n",
    "    high performance module that uses *bisect* to managed sorted\n",
    "    collections of data.\n",
    "-   The [SortedCollection\n",
    "    recipe](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/577197-sortedcollection/)\n",
    "    uses bisect to build a full-featured collection class with\n",
    "    straight-forward search methods and support for a key-function. The\n",

    "## Searching Sorted Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The above `bisect` functions are useful for finding insertion points but\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bisect` function can be useful for numeric table lookups. This\n",
