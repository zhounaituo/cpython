    "This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files\n",
    "just like the GNU programs `gzip` and `gunzip` would.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data compression is provided by the `zlib` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gzip` module provides the `GzipFile` class, as well as the `.open`,\n",
    "`compress` and `decompress` convenience functions. The `GzipFile` class\n",
    "reads and writes `gzip`-format files, automatically compressing or\n",
    "decompressing the data so that it looks like an ordinary `file object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the\n",
    "`gzip` and `gunzip` programs, such as those produced by `compress` and\n",
    "`pack`, are not supported by this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module defines the following items:\n",

    "open(filename, mode='rb', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None,\n",
    "newline=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a `file\n",
    "object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *filename* argument can be an actual filename (a `str` or `bytes`\n",
    "object), or an existing file object to read from or write to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *mode* argument can be any of `'r'`, `'rb'`, `'a'`, `'ab'`, `'w'`,\n",
    "`'wb'`, `'x'` or `'xb'` for binary mode, or `'rt'`, `'at'`, `'wt'`, or\n",
    "`'xt'` for text mode. The default is `'rb'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from 0 to 9, as for the\n",
    "`GzipFile` constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the `GzipFile`\n",
    "constructor: `GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel)`. In this case,\n",
    "the *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments must not be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "For text mode, a `GzipFile` object is created, and wrapped in an\n",
    "`io.TextIOWrapper` instance with the specified encoding, error handling\n",
    "behavior, and line ending(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Added support for *filename* being a file object, support for text\n",
    "mode, and the *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 Added support for the `'x'`, `'xb'` and `'xt'` modes.\n",

    "*fileobj*, if discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string,\n",
    "and in this case the original filename is not included in the header.\n",

    "The *mtime* argument is an optional numeric timestamp to be written to\n",
    "the last modification time field in the stream when compressing. It\n",

    "Calling a `GzipFile` object's `close` method does not close *fileobj*,\n",

    "\n",
    "Note\n",
