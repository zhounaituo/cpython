    "(If `ossaudiodev` receives an error from a system call such as :c`open`,\n",
    ":c`write`, or :c`ioctl`, it raises `OSError`. Errors detected directly\n",
    "by `ossaudiodev` result in `OSSAudioError`.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Before you can write to or read from an audio device, you must call\n",
    "three methods in the correct order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `setfmt` to set the output format\n",
    "2.  `channels` to set the number of channels\n",
    "3.  `speed` to set the sample rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternately, you can use the `setparameters` method to set all three\n",
    "audio parameters at once. This is more convenient, but may not be as\n",
    "flexible in all cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audio device objects returned by `.open` define the following\n",
    "methods and (read-only) attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "oss_audio_device.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicitly close the audio device. When you are done writing to or\n",
    "reading from an audio device, you should explicitly close it. A closed\n",
    "device cannot be used again.\n",
    "\n",
    "oss_audio_device.fileno()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the file descriptor associated with the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "oss_audio_device.read(size)\n",
    "\n",
    "Read *size* bytes from the audio input and return them as a Python\n",
    "string. Unlike most Unix device drivers, OSS audio devices in blocking\n",
    "mode (the default) will block `read` until the entire requested amount\n",
    "of data is available.\n",

    "oss_audio_device.write(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a `bytes-like object` *data* to the audio device and return the\n",
    "number of bytes written. If the audio device is in blocking mode (the\n",
    "default), the entire data is always written (again, this is different\n",
    "from usual Unix device semantics). If the device is in non-blocking\n",
    "mode, some data may not be written---see `writeall`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.5 Writable `bytes-like object` is now accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "oss_audio_device.writeall(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a `bytes-like object` *data* to the audio device: waits until the\n",
    "audio device is able to accept data, writes as much data as it will\n",
    "accept, and repeats until *data* has been completely written. If the\n",
    "device is in blocking mode (the default), this has the same effect as\n",
    "`write`; `writeall` is only useful in non-blocking mode. Has no return\n",

    "data supplied.\n",

    "3.2 Audio device objects also support the context management protocol,\n",
    "i.e. they can be used in a `with` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following methods each map to exactly one :c`ioctl` system call. The\n",
    "correspondence is obvious: for example, `setfmt` corresponds to the\n",
    "`SNDCTL_DSP_SETFMT` ioctl, and `sync` to `SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC` (this can be\n",
    "useful when consulting the OSS documentation). If the underlying\n",
    ":c`ioctl` fails, they all raise `OSError`.\n",
