    "The `pprint` module provides a capability to \"pretty-print\" arbitrary\n",
    "Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the\n",
    "interpreter. If the formatted structures include objects which are not\n",
    "fundamental Python types, the representation may not be loadable. This\n",
    "may be the case if objects such as files, sockets or classes are\n",

    "Python literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formatted representation keeps objects on a single line if it can,\n",

    "*depth* controls the number of nesting levels which may be printed; if\n",

    "the objects being formatted.\n",

    "*compact* impacts the way that long sequences (lists, tuples, sets, etc)\n",
