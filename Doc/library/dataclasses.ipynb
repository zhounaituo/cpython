    "The `dataclass` decorator examines the class to find `field`s. A `field`\n",

    "which they appear in the class definition.\n",

    "class, described below. If any of the added methods already exist in the\n",
    "class, the behavior depends on the parameter, as documented below. The\n",
    "decorator returns the same class that it is called on; no new class is\n",
    "created.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `dataclass` is used just as a simple decorator with no parameters, it\n",
    "acts as if it has the default values documented in this signature. That\n",
    "is, these three uses of `dataclass` are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "    @dataclass\n",
    "    class C:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    @dataclass()\n",
    "    class C:\n",
    "        ...\n",

    "    @dataclass(init=True, repr=True, eq=True, order=False, unsafe_hash=False, frozen=False, match_args=True, kw_only=False, slots=False, weakref_slot=False)\n",
    "    class C:\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters to `dataclass` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `init`: If true (the default), a `__init__` method will be\n",
    "    generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the class already defines `__init__`, this parameter is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `repr`: If true (the default), a `__repr__` method will be\n",
    "    generated. The generated repr string will have the class name and\n",
    "    the name and repr of each field, in the order they are defined in\n",
    "    the class. Fields that are marked as being excluded from the repr\n",
    "    are not included. For example:\n",

    "    and `eq` is false, a `ValueError` is raised.\n",

    "    to hashed collections such as dictionaries and sets. Having a\n",
    "    `__hash__` implies that instances of the class are immutable.\n",
    "    Mutability is a complicated property that depends on the\n",

    "    existing explicitly defined `__hash__` method. Setting the class\n",
    "    attribute `__hash__ = None` has a specific meaning to Python, as\n",

    "\n",
    "    If `__hash__` is not explicitly defined, or if it is set to `None`,\n",

    "    not recommended, you can force `dataclass` to create a `__hash__`\n",
    "    method with `unsafe_hash=True`. This might be the case if your class\n",
    "    is logically immutable but can nonetheless be mutated. This is a\n",
    "    specialized use case and should be considered carefully.\n",
