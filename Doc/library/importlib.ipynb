    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the `importlib` package is three-fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is to provide the implementation of the `import` statement (and\n",
    "thus, by extension, the `__import__` function) in Python source code.\n",
    "This provides an implementation of `!import` which is portable to any\n",
    "Python interpreter. This also provides an implementation which is easier\n",
    "to comprehend than one implemented in a programming language other than\n",
    "Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two, the components to implement `import` are exposed in this package,\n",
    "making it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known\n",
    "generically as an `importer`) to participate in the import process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three, the package contains modules exposing additional functionality\n",
    "for managing aspects of Python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `importlib.metadata` presents access to metadata from third-party\n",
    "    distributions.\n",
    "-   `importlib.resources` provides routines for accessing non-code\n",

    "resolving the package name (e.g. `import_module('..mod', 'pkg.subpkg')`\n",
    "will import `pkg.mod`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import_module` function acts as a simplifying wrapper around\n",
    "`importlib.__import__`. This means all semantics of the function are\n",
    "derived from `importlib.__import__`. The most important difference\n",
    "between these two functions is that `import_module` returns the\n",
    "specified package or module (e.g. `pkg.mod`), while `__import__` returns\n",
    "the top-level package or module (e.g. `pkg`).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a number of other caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the module's\n",
    "global variables) is retained. Redefinitions of names will override the\n",
    "old definitions, so this is generally not a problem. If the new version\n",
    "of a module does not define a name that was defined by the old version,\n",
    "the old definition remains. This feature can be used to the module's\n",
    "advantage if it maintains a global table or cache of objects --- with a\n",
    "`try` statement it can test for the table's presence and skip its\n",

    "It is generally not very useful to reload built-in or dynamically loaded\n",
