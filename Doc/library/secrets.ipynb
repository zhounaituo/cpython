    "To be secure against [brute-force\n",
    "attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack), tokens need\n",
    "to have sufficient randomness. Unfortunately, what is considered\n",
    "sufficient will necessarily increase as computers get more powerful and\n",
    "able to make more guesses in a shorter period. As of 2015, it is\n",
    "believed that 32 bytes (256 bits) of randomness is sufficient for the\n",
    "typical use-case expected for the `secrets` module.\n",

    "For those who want to manage their own token length, you can explicitly\n",
    "specify how much randomness is used for tokens by giving an `int`\n",
    "argument to the various `token_*` functions. That argument is taken as\n",
    "the number of bytes of randomness to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, if no argument is provided, or if the argument is `None`, the\n",
    "`token_*` functions will use a reasonable default instead.\n",
    "\n",
