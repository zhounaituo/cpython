    "When using any of the policy objects derived from\n",
    "`~email.policy.EmailPolicy`, all headers are produced by\n",
    "`.HeaderRegistry` and have `.BaseHeader` as their last base class. Each\n",
    "header class has an additional base class that is determined by the type\n",
    "of the header. For example, many headers have the class\n",
    "`.UnstructuredHeader` as their other base class. The specialized second\n",
    "class for a header is determined by the name of the header, using a\n",
    "lookup table stored in the `.HeaderRegistry`. All of this is managed\n",
    "transparently for the typical application program, but interfaces are\n",
    "provided for modifying the default behavior for use by more complex\n",
    "applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sections below first document the header base classes and their\n",

    "`~email.policy.EmailPolicy.utf8` is `False`, non-ASCII data will be\n",
    "`2047` encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BaseHeader` by itself cannot be used to create a header object. It\n",
    "defines a protocol that each specialized header cooperates with in order\n",
    "to produce the header object. Specifically, `BaseHeader` requires that\n",
    "the specialized class provide a `classmethod` named `parse`. This method\n",
    "is called as follows:\n",

    "values for at least the keys `decoded` and `defects`. `decoded` should\n",
    "be the string value for the header (that is, the header value fully\n",
    "decoded to unicode). The parse method should assume that *string* may\n",
    "contain content-transfer-encoded parts, but should correctly handle all\n",
    "valid unicode characters as well so that it can parse un-encoded header\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BaseHeader`'s `__new__` then creates the header instance, and calls its\n",
    "`init` method. The specialized class only needs to provide an `init`\n",
    "method if it wishes to set additional attributes beyond those provided\n",
    "by `BaseHeader` itself. Such an `init` method should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def init(self, /, *args, **kw):\n",
    "        self._myattr = kw.pop('myattr')\n",

    "`kw` (and `args`) passed to the `BaseHeader` `init` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"unstructured\" header is the default type of header in `5322`. Any\n",
    "header that does not have a specified syntax is treated as unstructured.\n",
    "The classic example of an unstructured header is the `Subject` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `5322`, an unstructured header is a run of arbitrary text in the\n",
    "ASCII character set. `2047`, however, has an `5322` compatible mechanism\n",
    "for encoding non-ASCII text as ASCII characters within a header value.\n",
    "When a *value* containing encoded words is passed to the constructor,\n",
    "the `UnstructuredHeader` parser converts such encoded words into\n",
    "unicode, following the `2047` rules for unstructured text. The parser\n",
    "uses heuristics to attempt to decode certain non-compliant encoded\n",
    "words. Defects are registered in such cases, as well as defects for\n",
    "issues such as invalid characters within the encoded words or the\n",
    "non-encoded text.\n",

    "This header type provides no additional attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`5322` specifies a very specific format for dates within email headers.\n",
    "The `DateHeader` parser recognizes that date format, as well as\n",

    "wild\".\n",

    "\n",
    "datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "If the header value can be recognized as a valid date of one form or\n",

    "as `-0000` (indicating it is in UTC but contains no information about\n",
    "the source timezone), then `.datetime` will be a naive\n",
    "`~datetime.datetime`. If a specific timezone offset is found (including\n",

    "Because this is a naive `datetime` it will be interpreted as a UTC\n",
    "timestamp, and the resulting value will have a timezone of `-0000`. Much\n",
    "more useful is to use the `~email.utils.localtime` function from the\n",
    "`~email.utils` module:\n",
