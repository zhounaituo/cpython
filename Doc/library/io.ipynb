    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "single: file object; io module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `io` module provides Python's main facilities for dealing with\n",
    "various types of I/O. There are three main types of I/O: *text I/O*,\n",
    "*binary I/O* and *raw I/O*. These are generic categories, and various\n",
    "backing stores can be used for each of them. A concrete object belonging\n",
    "to any of these categories is called a `file object`. Other common terms\n",
    "are *stream* and *file-like object*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent of its category, each concrete stream object will also have\n",
    "various capabilities: it can be read-only, write-only, or read-write. It\n",
    "can also allow arbitrary random access (seeking forwards or backwards to\n",
    "any location), or only sequential access (for example in the case of a\n",
    "socket or pipe).\n",
    "\n",
    "All streams are careful about the type of data you give to them. For\n",
    "example giving a `str` object to the `write()` method of a binary stream\n",
    "will raise a `TypeError`. So will giving a `bytes` object to the\n",
    "`write()` method of a text stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Operations that used to raise `IOError` now raise `OSError`, since\n",
    "`IOError` is now an alias of `OSError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Text I/O expects and produces `str` objects. This means that whenever\n",
    "the backing store is natively made of bytes (such as in the case of a\n",
    "file), encoding and decoding of data is made transparently as well as\n",
    "optional translation of platform-specific newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to create a text stream is with `open()`, optionally\n",
    "specifying an encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory text streams are also available as `StringIO` objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f = io.StringIO(\"some initial text data\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The text stream API is described in detail in the documentation of\n",
    "`TextIOBase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary I/O (also called *buffered I/O*) expects\n",
    "`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` and produces `bytes` objects.\n",
    "No encoding, decoding, or newline translation is performed. This\n",
    "category of streams can be used for all kinds of non-text data, and also\n",
    "when manual control over the handling of text data is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to create a binary stream is with `open()` with `'b'` in\n",
    "the mode string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f = open(\"myfile.jpg\", \"rb\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In-memory binary streams are also available as `BytesIO` objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f = io.BytesIO(b\"some initial binary data: \\x00\\x01\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary stream API is described in detail in the docs of\n",
    "`BufferedIOBase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other library modules may provide additional ways to create text or\n",
    "binary streams. See `socket.socket.makefile` for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw I/O (also called *unbuffered I/O*) is generally used as a low-level\n",
    "building-block for binary and text streams; it is rarely useful to\n",
    "directly manipulate a raw stream from user code. Nevertheless, you can\n",
    "create a raw stream by opening a file in binary mode with buffering\n",
    "disabled:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f = open(\"myfile.jpg\", \"rb\", buffering=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw stream API is described in detail in the docs of `RawIOBase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The default encoding of `TextIOWrapper` and `open` is locale-specific\n",
    "(`locale.getencoding`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many developers forget to specify the encoding when opening\n",
    "text files encoded in UTF-8 (e.g. JSON, TOML, Markdown, etc...) since\n",
    "most Unix platforms use UTF-8 locale by default. This causes bugs\n",
    "because the locale encoding is not UTF-8 for most Windows users. For\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # May not work on Windows when non-ASCII characters in the file.\n",
    "    with open(\"README.md\") as f:\n",
    "        long_description = f.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, while there is no concrete plan as of yet, Python may\n",
    "change the default text file encoding to UTF-8 in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, it is highly recommended that you specify the encoding\n",
    "explicitly when opening text files. If you want to use UTF-8, pass\n",
    "`encoding=\"utf-8\"`. To use the current locale encoding,\n",
    "`encoding=\"locale\"` is supported in Python 3.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need to run existing code on Windows that attempts to open\n",
    "UTF-8 files using the default locale encoding, you can enable the UTF-8\n",
    "mode. See `UTF-8 mode on Windows <win-utf8-mode>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opt-in EncodingWarning\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10 See `597` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find where the default locale encoding is used, you can enable the\n",
    "`-X warn_default_encoding` command line option or set the\n",
    "`PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING` environment variable, which will emit an\n",
    "`EncodingWarning` when the default encoding is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are providing an API that uses `open` or `TextIOWrapper` and\n",
    "passes `encoding=None` as a parameter, you can use `text_encoding` so\n",
    "that callers of the API will emit an `EncodingWarning` if they don't\n",
    "pass an `encoding`. However, please consider using UTF-8 by default\n",
    "(i.e. `encoding=\"utf-8\"`) for new APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-level Module Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE\n",
    "\n",
    "An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered\n",
    "I/O classes. `open` uses the file's blksize (as obtained by `os.stat`)\n",
    "if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None,\n",
    "newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an alias for the builtin `open` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "open path,mode,flags io.open\n",
    "\n",
    "This function raises an `auditing event <auditing>` `open` with\n",
    "arguments `path`, `mode` and `flags`. The `mode` and `flags` arguments\n",
    "may have been modified or inferred from the original call.\n",
    "\n",
    "open_code(path)\n",
    "\n",
    "Opens the provided file with mode `'rb'`. This function should be used\n",
    "when the intent is to treat the contents as executable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`path` should be a `str` and an absolute path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of this function may be overridden by an earlier call to\n",
    "the :c`PyFile_SetOpenCodeHook`. However, assuming that `path` is a `str`\n",
    "and an absolute path, `open_code(path)` should always behave the same as\n",
    "`open(path, 'rb')`. Overriding the behavior is intended for additional\n",
    "validation or preprocessing of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.8\n",
    "\n",
    "text_encoding(encoding, stacklevel=2, /)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a helper function for callables that use `open` or\n",
    "`TextIOWrapper` and have an `encoding=None` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function returns *encoding* if it is not `None`. Otherwise, it\n",
    "returns `\"locale\"` or `\"utf-8\"` depending on `UTF-8 Mode <utf8-mode>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function emits an `EncodingWarning` if\n",
    "`sys.flags.warn_default_encoding <sys.flags>` is true and *encoding* is\n",
    "`None`. *stacklevel* specifies where the warning is emitted. For\n",
    "example:\n",

    "    def read_text(path, encoding=None):\n",
    "        encoding = io.text_encoding(encoding)  # stacklevel=2\n",
    "        with open(path, encoding) as f:\n",
    "            return f.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, an `EncodingWarning` is emitted for the caller of\n",
    "`read_text()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `io-text-encoding` for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "3.11 `text_encoding` returns \"utf-8\" when UTF-8 mode is enabled and\n",
    "*encoding* is `None`.\n",

    "`sys.stderr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of I/O streams is organized as a hierarchy of\n",
    "classes. First `abstract base classes <abstract base class>` (ABCs),\n",
    "which are used to specify the various categories of streams, then\n",
    "concrete classes providing the standard stream implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The abstract base classes also provide default implementations of some\n",
    "> methods in order to help implementation of concrete stream classes.\n",
    "> For example, `BufferedIOBase` provides unoptimized implementations of\n",
    "> `~IOBase.readinto` and `~IOBase.readline`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class `IOBase`. It\n",
    "defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no\n",
    "separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are\n",
    "allowed to raise `UnsupportedOperation` if they do not support a given\n",
    "operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RawIOBase` ABC extends `IOBase`. It deals with the reading and\n",
    "writing of bytes to a stream. `FileIO` subclasses `RawIOBase` to provide\n",
    "an interface to files in the machine's file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BufferedIOBase` ABC extends `IOBase`. It deals with buffering on a\n",

    "\n",
    "Even though `IOBase` does not declare `read` or `write` because their\n",
    "signatures will vary, implementations and clients should consider those\n",
    "methods part of the interface. Also, implementations may raise a\n",
    "`ValueError` (or `UnsupportedOperation`) when operations they do not\n",
    "support are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is\n",
    "`bytes`. Other `bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` are accepted as\n",
    "method arguments too. Text I/O classes work with `str` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that calling any method (even inquiries) on a closed stream is\n",
    "undefined. Implementations may raise `ValueError` in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "`IOBase` (and its subclasses) supports the iterator protocol, meaning\n",
    "that an `IOBase` object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a\n",
    "stream. Lines are defined slightly differently depending on whether the\n",
    "stream is a binary stream (yielding bytes), or a text stream (yielding\n",
    "character strings). See `~IOBase.readline` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "`IOBase` is also a context manager and therefore supports the `with`\n",

    "\n",
    "This section discusses the performance of the provided concrete I/O\n",
    "implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "By reading and writing only large chunks of data even when the user asks\n",
    "for a single byte, buffered I/O hides any inefficiency in calling and\n",
    "executing the operating system's unbuffered I/O routines. The gain\n",
    "depends on the OS and the kind of I/O which is performed. For example,\n",
    "on some modern OSes such as Linux, unbuffered disk I/O can be as fast as\n",
    "buffered I/O. The bottom line, however, is that buffered I/O offers\n",
    "predictable performance regardless of the platform and the backing\n",
    "device. Therefore, it is almost always preferable to use buffered I/O\n",
    "rather than unbuffered I/O for binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "Text I/O over a binary storage (such as a file) is significantly slower\n",
    "than binary I/O over the same storage, because it requires conversions\n",
    "between unicode and binary data using a character codec. This can become\n",
    "noticeable handling huge amounts of text data like large log files.\n",
    "Also, `TextIOWrapper.tell` and `TextIOWrapper.seek` are both quite slow\n",
    "due to the reconstruction algorithm used.\n",
    "\n",
    "`StringIO`, however, is a native in-memory unicode container and will\n",
    "exhibit similar speed to `BytesIO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-threading\n",
    "\n",
    "`FileIO` objects are thread-safe to the extent that the operating system\n",
    "calls (such as `read(2)` under Unix) they wrap are thread-safe too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary buffered objects (instances of `BufferedReader`,\n",
    "`BufferedWriter`, `BufferedRandom` and `BufferedRWPair`) protect their\n",
    "internal structures using a lock; it is therefore safe to call them from\n",
    "multiple threads at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "`TextIOWrapper` objects are not thread-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reentrancy\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary buffered objects (instances of `BufferedReader`,\n",
    "`BufferedWriter`, `BufferedRandom` and `BufferedRWPair`) are not\n",
    "reentrant. While reentrant calls will not happen in normal situations,\n",
    "they can arise from doing I/O in a `signal` handler. If a thread tries\n",
    "to re-enter a buffered object which it is already accessing, a\n",
    "`RuntimeError` is raised. Note this doesn't prohibit a different thread\n",
    "from entering the buffered object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above implicitly extends to text files, since the `open()` function\n",
    "will wrap a buffered object inside a `TextIOWrapper`. This includes\n",
    "standard streams and therefore affects the built-in `print()` function\n",
    "as well."
