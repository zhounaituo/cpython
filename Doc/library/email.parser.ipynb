    "**Source code:** `Lib/email/parser.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Message object structures can be created in one of two ways: they can be\n",
    "created from whole cloth by creating an `~email.message.EmailMessage`\n",
    "object, adding headers using the dictionary interface, and adding\n",
    "payload(s) using `~email.message.EmailMessage.set_content` and related\n",
    "methods, or they can be created by parsing a serialized representation\n",
    "of the email message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `email` package provides a standard parser that understands most\n",
    "email document structures, including MIME documents. You can pass the\n",
    "parser a bytes, string or file object, and the parser will return to you\n",
    "the root `~email.message.EmailMessage` instance of the object structure.\n",
    "For simple, non-MIME messages the payload of this root object will\n",
    "likely be a string containing the text of the message. For MIME\n",
    "messages, the root object will return `True` from its\n",
    "`~email.message.EmailMessage.is_multipart` method, and the subparts can\n",
    "be accessed via the payload manipulation methods, such as\n",
    "`~email.message.EmailMessage.get_body`,\n",
    "`~email.message.EmailMessage.iter_parts`, and\n",
    "`~email.message.EmailMessage.walk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually two parser interfaces available for use, the `Parser`\n",
    "API and the incremental `FeedParser` API. The `Parser` API is most\n",
    "useful if you have the entire text of the message in memory, or if the\n",
    "entire message lives in a file on the file system. `FeedParser` is more\n",
    "appropriate when you are reading the message from a stream which might\n",
    "block waiting for more input (such as reading an email message from a\n",
    "socket). The `FeedParser` can consume and parse the message\n",
    "incrementally, and only returns the root object when you close the\n",
    "parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the parser can be extended in limited ways, and of course you\n",
    "can implement your own parser completely from scratch. All of the logic\n",
    "that connects the `email` package's bundled parser and the\n",
    "`~email.message.EmailMessage` class is embodied in the `policy` class,\n",
    "so a custom parser can create message object trees any way it finds\n",
    "necessary by implementing custom versions of the appropriate `policy`\n",
    "methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FeedParser API\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BytesFeedParser`, imported from the `email.feedparser` module,\n",
    "provides an API that is conducive to incremental parsing of email\n",
    "messages, such as would be necessary when reading the text of an email\n",
    "message from a source that can block (such as a socket). The\n",
    "`BytesFeedParser` can of course be used to parse an email message fully\n",
    "contained in a `bytes-like\n",
    "object`, string, or file, but the `BytesParser` API may be more\n",
    "convenient for such use cases. The semantics and results of the two\n",
    "parser APIs are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BytesFeedParser`'s API is simple; you create an instance, feed it a\n",
    "bunch of bytes until there's no more to feed it, then close the parser\n",
    "to retrieve the root message object. The `BytesFeedParser` is extremely\n",
    "accurate when parsing standards-compliant messages, and it does a very\n",
    "good job of parsing non-compliant messages, providing information about\n",
    "how a message was deemed broken. It will populate a message object's\n",
    "`~email.message.EmailMessage.defects` attribute with a list of any\n",
    "problems it found in a message. See the `email.errors` module for the\n",
    "list of defects that it can find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the API for the `BytesFeedParser`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `BytesFeedParser` instance. Optional *\\_factory* is a\n",
    "no-argument callable; if not specified use the\n",
    "`~email.policy.Policy.message_factory` from the *policy*. Call\n",
    "*\\_factory* whenever a new message object is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *policy* is specified use the rules it specifies to update the\n",
    "representation of the message. If *policy* is not set, use the\n",
    "`compat32 <email.policy.Compat32>` policy, which maintains backward\n",
    "compatibility with the Python 3.2 version of the email package and\n",
    "provides `~email.message.Message` as the default factory. All other\n",
    "policies provide `~email.message.EmailMessage` as the default\n",
    "*\\_factory*. For more information on what else *policy* controls, see\n",
    "the `~email.policy` documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **The policy keyword should always be specified**; The default\n",
    "will change to `email.policy.default` in a future version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Added the *policy* keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 *\\_factory* defaults to the policy `message_factory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "feed(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feed the parser some more data. *data* should be a `bytes-like\n",
    "object` containing one or more lines. The lines can be partial and the\n",
    "parser will stitch such partial lines together properly. The lines can\n",
    "have any of the three common line endings: carriage return, newline, or\n",
    "carriage return and newline (they can even be mixed).\n",
    "\n",
    "close()\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the parsing of all previously fed data and return the root\n",
    "message object. It is undefined what happens if `~feed` is called after\n",
    "this method has been called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Works like `BytesFeedParser` except that the input to the\n",
    "`~BytesFeedParser.feed` method must be a string. This is of limited\n",
    "utility, since the only way for such a message to be valid is for it to\n",
    "contain only ASCII text or, if `~email.policy.Policy.utf8` is `True`, no\n",
    "binary attachments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Added the *policy* keyword.\n",

    "## Parser API\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BytesParser` class, imported from the `email.parser` module,\n",
    "provides an API that can be used to parse a message when the complete\n",
    "contents of the message are available in a `bytes-like object` or file.\n",
    "The `email.parser` module also provides `Parser` for parsing strings,\n",
    "and header-only parsers, `BytesHeaderParser` and `HeaderParser`, which\n",
    "can be used if you're only interested in the headers of the message.\n",
    "`BytesHeaderParser` and `HeaderParser` can be much faster in these\n",
    "situations, since they do not attempt to parse the message body, instead\n",
    "setting the payload to the raw body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `BytesParser` instance. The *\\_class* and *policy* arguments\n",
    "have the same meaning and semantics as the *\\_factory* and *policy*\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: **The policy keyword should always be specified**; The default\n",
    "will change to `email.policy.default` in a future version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Removed the *strict* argument that was deprecated in 2.4. Added the\n",
    "*policy* keyword.\n",

    "3.6 *\\_class* defaults to the policy `message_factory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "parse(fp, headersonly=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "Read all the data from the binary file-like object *fp*, parse the\n",

    "The bytes contained in *fp* must be formatted as a block of `5322` (or,\n",
    "if `~email.policy.Policy.utf8` is `True`, `6532`) style headers and\n",
    "header continuation lines, optionally preceded by an envelope header.\n",
    "The header block is terminated either by the end of the data or by a\n",
    "blank line. Following the header block is the body of the message (which\n",
    "may contain MIME-encoded subparts, including subparts with a\n",
    "`Content-Transfer-Encoding` of `8bit`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional *headersonly* is a flag specifying whether to stop parsing\n",
    "after reading the headers or not. The default is `False`, meaning it\n",
    "parses the entire contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "parsebytes(bytes, headersonly=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the `parse` method, except it takes a `bytes-like\n",
    "object` instead of a file-like object. Calling this method on a\n",

    "Optional *headersonly* is as with the `parse` method.\n",

    "Read all the data from the text-mode file-like object *fp*, parse the\n",

    "\n",
    "Similar to the `parse` method, except it takes a string object instead\n",
