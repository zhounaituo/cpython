    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

    "The `bdb` module handles basic debugger functions, like setting\n",
    "breakpoints or managing execution via the debugger.\n",

    "The following exception is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "BdbQuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception raised by the `Bdb` class for quitting the debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bdb` module also defines two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "This class implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling\n",
    "and (re-)enabling, and conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakpoints are indexed by number through a list called `bpbynumber` and\n",
    "by `(file, line)` pairs through `bplist`. The former points to a single\n",
    "instance of class `Breakpoint`. The latter points to a list of such\n",
    "instances since there may be more than one breakpoint per line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a breakpoint, its associated filename should be in\n",
    "canonical form. If a *funcname* is defined, a breakpoint hit will be\n",
    "counted when the first line of that function is executed. A conditional\n",
    "breakpoint always counts a hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Breakpoint` instances have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "deleteMe()\n",
    "\n",
    "Delete the breakpoint from the list associated to a file/line. If it is\n",
    "the last breakpoint in that position, it also deletes the entry for the\n",

    "The `Bdb` class acts as a generic Python debugger base class.\n",

    "(`pdb.Pdb`) is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *skip* argument, if given, must be an iterable of glob-style module\n",
