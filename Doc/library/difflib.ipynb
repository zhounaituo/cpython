    "This module provides classes and functions for comparing sequences. It\n",
    "can be used for example, for comparing files, and can produce\n",
    "information about file differences in various formats, including HTML\n",
    "and context and unified diffs. For comparing directories and files, see\n",
    "also, the `filecmp` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of any type,\n",
    "so long as the sequence elements are `hashable`. The basic algorithm\n",
    "predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm published in the\n",
    "late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the hyperbolic name \"gestalt\n",
    "pattern matching.\" The idea is to find the longest contiguous matching\n",
    "subsequence that contains no \"junk\" elements; these \"junk\" elements are\n",
    "ones that are uninteresting in some sense, such as blank lines or\n",
    "whitespace. (Handling junk is an extension to the Ratcliff and Obershelp\n",
    "algorithm.) The same idea is then applied recursively to the pieces of\n",
    "the sequences to the left and to the right of the matching subsequence.\n",
    "This does not yield minimal edit sequences, but does tend to yield\n",
    "matches that \"look right\" to people.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timing:** The basic Ratcliff-Obershelp algorithm is cubic time in the\n",
    "worst case and quadratic time in the expected case. `SequenceMatcher` is\n",
    "quadratic time for the worst case and has expected-case behavior\n",
    "dependent in a complicated way on how many elements the sequences have\n",
    "in common; best case time is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic junk heuristic:** `SequenceMatcher` supports a heuristic\n",
    "that automatically treats certain sequence items as junk. The heuristic\n",
    "counts how many times each individual item appears in the sequence. If\n",
    "an item's duplicates (after the first one) account for more than 1% of\n",
    "the sequence and the sequence is at least 200 items long, this item is\n",
    "marked as \"popular\" and is treated as junk for the purpose of sequence\n",
    "matching. This heuristic can be turned off by setting the `autojunk`\n",
    "argument to `False` when creating the `SequenceMatcher`.\n",

    "This is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and producing\n",
    "human-readable differences or deltas. Differ uses `SequenceMatcher` both\n",
    "to compare sequences of lines, and to compare sequences of characters\n",
    "within similar (near-matching) lines.\n",
