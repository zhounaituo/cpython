    "made up of a header block followed by data blocks. It is possible to\n",

    "\n",
    "A `TarFile` object can be used as a context manager in a `with`\n",
    "statement. It will automatically be closed when the block is completed.\n",
    "Please note that in the event of an exception an archive opened for\n",
    "writing will not be finalized; only the internally used file object will\n",
    "be closed. See the `tar-examples` section for a use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Added support for the context management protocol.\n",
    "\n",

    "attributes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*name* is the pathname of the archive. *name* may be a\n",
    "`path-like object`. It can be omitted if *fileobj* is given. In this\n",
    "case, the file object's `name` attribute is used if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "*mode* is either `'r'` to read from an existing archive, `'a'` to append\n",
    "data to an existing file, `'w'` to create a new file overwriting an\n",
    "existing one, or `'x'` to create a new file only if it does not already\n",
    "exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *fileobj* is given, it is used for reading or writing data. If it can\n",

    "even if different formats are present in a single archive.\n",

    "## Supported tar formats\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three tar formats that can be created with the `tarfile`\n",
    "module:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The POSIX.1-1988 ustar format (`USTAR_FORMAT`). It supports\n",
    "    filenames up to a length of at best 256 characters and linknames up\n",
    "    to 100 characters. The maximum file size is 8 GiB. This is an old\n",
    "    and limited but widely supported format.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The GNU tar format (`GNU_FORMAT`). It supports long filenames and\n",
    "    linknames, files bigger than 8 GiB and sparse files. It is the de\n",
    "    facto standard on GNU/Linux systems. `tarfile` fully supports the\n",
    "    GNU tar extensions for long names, sparse file support is read-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The POSIX.1-2001 pax format (`PAX_FORMAT`). It is the most flexible\n",
    "    format with virtually no limits. It supports long filenames and\n",
    "    linknames, large files and stores pathnames in a portable way.\n",
    "    Modern tar implementations, including GNU tar, bsdtar/libarchive and\n",
    "    star, fully support extended *pax* features; some old or\n",
    "    unmaintained libraries may not, but should treat *pax* archives as\n",
    "    if they were in the universally-supported *ustar* format. It is the\n",
    "    current default format for new archives.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It extends the existing *ustar* format with extra headers for\n",
    "    information that cannot be stored otherwise. There are two flavours\n",
    "    of pax headers: Extended headers only affect the subsequent file\n",
    "    header, global headers are valid for the complete archive and affect\n",
    "    all following files. All the data in a pax header is encoded in\n",
    "    *UTF-8* for portability reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some more variants of the tar format which can be read, but\n",
    "not created:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The ancient V7 format. This is the first tar format from Unix\n",
    "    Seventh Edition, storing only regular files and directories. Names\n",
    "    must not be longer than 100 characters, there is no user/group name\n",
    "    information. Some archives have miscalculated header checksums in\n",
    "    case of fields with non-ASCII characters.\n",
    "-   The SunOS tar extended format. This format is a variant of the\n",
    "    POSIX.1-2001 pax format, but is not compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unicode issues\n",
    "\n",
    "The tar format was originally conceived to make backups on tape drives\n",
    "with the main focus on preserving file system information. Nowadays tar\n",
    "archives are commonly used for file distribution and exchanging archives\n",
    "over networks. One problem of the original format (which is the basis of\n",
    "all other formats) is that there is no concept of supporting different\n",
    "character encodings. For example, an ordinary tar archive created on a\n",
    "*UTF-8* system cannot be read correctly on a *Latin-1* system if it\n",
    "contains non-*ASCII* characters. Textual metadata (like filenames,\n",
    "linknames, user/group names) will appear damaged. Unfortunately, there\n",
    "is no way to autodetect the encoding of an archive. The pax format was\n",
    "designed to solve this problem. It stores non-ASCII metadata using the\n",
    "universal character encoding *UTF-8*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of character conversion in `tarfile` are controlled by the\n",
    "*encoding* and *errors* keyword arguments of the `TarFile` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "*encoding* defines the character encoding to use for the metadata in the\n",
    "archive. The default value is `sys.getfilesystemencoding` or `'ascii'`\n",
    "as a fallback. Depending on whether the archive is read or written, the\n",
    "metadata must be either decoded or encoded. If *encoding* is not set\n",
    "appropriately, this conversion may fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *errors* argument defines how characters are treated that cannot be\n",
    "converted. Possible values are listed in section `error-handlers`. The\n",
    "default scheme is `'surrogateescape'` which Python also uses for its\n",
    "file system calls, see `os-filenames`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `PAX_FORMAT` archives (the default), *encoding* is generally not\n",
    "needed because all the metadata is stored using *UTF-8*. *encoding* is\n",
    "only used in the rare cases when binary pax headers are decoded or when\n",
    "strings with surrogate characters are stored."
