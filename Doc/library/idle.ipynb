    "\n",
    "IDLE is Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE has the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   coded in 100% pure Python, using the `tkinter` GUI toolkit\n",
    "-   cross-platform: works mostly the same on Windows, Unix, and macOS\n",
    "-   Python shell window (interactive interpreter) with colorizing of\n",
    "    code input, output, and error messages\n",
    "-   multi-window text editor with multiple undo, Python colorizing,\n",
    "    smart indent, call tips, auto completion, and other features\n",
    "-   search within any window, replace within editor windows, and search\n",
    "    through multiple files (grep)\n",
    "-   debugger with persistent breakpoints, stepping, and viewing of\n",
    "    global and local namespaces\n",
    "-   configuration, browsers, and other dialogs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Menus\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE has two main window types, the Shell window and the Editor window.\n",
    "It is possible to have multiple editor windows simultaneously. On\n",
    "Windows and Linux, each has its own top menu. Each menu documented below\n",
    "indicates which window type it is associated with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output windows, such as used for Edit =\\> Find in Files, are a subtype\n",
    "of editor window. They currently have the same top menu but a different\n",
    "default title and context menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS, there is one application menu. It dynamically changes\n",
    "according to the window currently selected. It has an IDLE menu, and\n",

    "open editor window for a given file.\n",

    "with 1; column numbers with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE assumes that files with a known .py\\* extension contain Python code\n",
    "and that other files do not. Run Python code with the Run menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, 'C' refers to the `Control` key on Windows and Unix and\n",
    "the `Command` key on macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `Backspace` deletes to the left; `Del` deletes to the right\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `C-Backspace` delete word left; `C-Del` delete word to the right\n",

    "    > -   `C-a` beginning of line\n",
    "    > -   `C-e` end of line\n",

    "    >     for this)\n",
    "    > -   `C-d` delete next character\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard keybindings (like `C-c` to copy and `C-v` to paste) may work.\n",
    "Keybindings are selected in the Configure IDLE dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "After a block-opening statement, the next line is indented by 4 spaces\n",
    "(in the Python Shell window by one tab). After certain keywords (break,\n",
    "return etc.) the next line is dedented. In leading indentation,\n",
    "`Backspace` deletes up to 4 spaces if they are there. `Tab` inserts\n",
    "spaces (in the Python Shell window one tab), number depends on Indent\n",

    "limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also the indent/dedent region commands on the\n",
    "`Format menu <format-menu>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Completions\n",
    "\n",
    "Completions are supplied, when requested and available, for module\n",
    "names, attributes of classes or functions, or filenames. Each request\n",
    "method displays a completion box with existing names. (See tab\n",
    "completions below for an exception.) For any box, change the name being\n",
    "completed and the item highlighted in the box by typing and deleting\n",
    "characters; by hitting `Up`, `Down`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Home`, and\n",
    "`End` keys; and by a single click within the box. Close the box with\n",
    "`Escape`, `Enter`, and double `Tab` keys or clicks outside the box. A\n",
    "double click within the box selects and closes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to open a box is to type a key character and wait for a\n",
    "predefined interval. This defaults to 2 seconds; customize it in the\n",
    "settings dialog. (To prevent auto popups, set the delay to a large\n",
    "number of milliseconds, such as 100000000.) For imported module names or\n",
    "class or function attributes, type '.'. For filenames in the root\n",
    "directory, type `os.sep` or `os.altsep` immediately after an opening\n",
    "quote. (On Windows, one can specify a drive first.) Move into\n",
    "subdirectories by typing a directory name and a separator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of waiting, or after a box is closed, open a completion box\n",
    "immediately with Show Completions on the Edit menu. The default hot key\n",
    "is `C-space`. If one types a prefix for the desired name before opening\n",
    "the box, the first match or near miss is made visible. The result is the\n",
    "same as if one enters a prefix after the box is displayed. Show\n",
    "Completions after a quote completes filenames in the current directory\n",
    "instead of a root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hitting `Tab` after a prefix usually has the same effect as Show\n",
    "Completions. (With no prefix, it indents.) However, if there is only one\n",
    "match to the prefix, that match is immediately added to the editor text\n",
    "without opening a box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoking 'Show Completions', or hitting `Tab` after a prefix, outside of\n",
    "a string and without a preceding '.' opens a box with keywords, builtin\n",
    "names, and available module-level names.\n",
    "\n",
    "When editing code in an editor (as oppose to Shell), increase the\n",
    "available module-level names by running your code and not restarting the\n",
    "Shell thereafter. This is especially useful after adding imports at the\n",
    "top of a file. This also increases possible attribute completions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completion boxes initially exclude names beginning with '\\_' or, for\n",
    "modules, not included in '\\_\\_all\\_\\_'. The hidden names can be accessed\n",
    "by typing '\\_' after '.', either before or after the box is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calltips\n",
    "\n",
    "A calltip is shown automatically when one types `(` after the name of an\n",
    "*accessible* function. A function name expression may include dots and\n",
    "subscripts. A calltip remains until it is clicked, the cursor is moved\n",
    "out of the argument area, or `)` is typed. Whenever the cursor is in the\n",
    "argument part of a definition, select Edit and \"Show Call Tip\" on the\n",
    "menu or enter its shortcut to display a calltip.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calltip consists of the function's signature and docstring up to the\n",
    "latter's first blank line or the fifth non-blank line. (Some builtin\n",
    "functions lack an accessible signature.) A '/' or '\\*' in the signature\n",
    "indicates that the preceding or following arguments are passed by\n",
    "position or name (keyword) only. Details are subject to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Shell, the accessible functions depends on what modules have been\n",
    "imported into the user process, including those imported by Idle itself,\n",
    "and which definitions have been run, all since the last restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, restart the Shell and enter `itertools.count(`. A calltip\n",
    "appears because Idle imports itertools into the user process for its own\n",
    "use. (This could change.) Enter `turtle.write(` and nothing appears.\n",
    "Idle does not itself import turtle. The menu entry and shortcut also do\n",
    "nothing. Enter `import turtle`. Thereafter, `turtle.write(` will display\n",
    "a calltip.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Code Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Within an editor window containing Python code, code context can be\n",
    "toggled in order to show or hide a pane at the top of the window. When\n",
    "shown, this pane freezes the opening lines for block code, such as those\n",
    "beginning with `class`, `def`, or `if` keywords, that would have\n",
    "otherwise scrolled out of view. The size of the pane will be expanded\n",
    "and contracted as needed to show the all current levels of context, up\n",
    "to the maximum number of lines defined in the Configure IDLE dialog\n",
    "(which defaults to 15). If there are no current context lines and the\n",
    "feature is toggled on, a single blank line will display. Clicking on a\n",
    "line in the context pane will move that line to the top of the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text and background colors for the context pane can be configured\n",
    "under the Highlights tab in the Configure IDLE dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Shell window\n",
    "\n",
    "With IDLE's Shell, one enters, edits, and recalls complete statements.\n",
    "Most consoles and terminals only work with a single physical line at a\n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When one pastes code into Shell, it is not compiled and possibly\n",
    "executed until one hits `Return`. One may edit pasted code first. If one\n",
    "pastes more that one statement into Shell, the result will be a\n",
    "`SyntaxError` when multiple statements are compiled as if they were one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The editing features described in previous subsections work when\n",
    "entering code interactively. IDLE's Shell window also responds to the\n",
    "following keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `C-c` interrupts executing command\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `C-d` sends end-of-file; closes window if typed at a `>>>` prompt\n",

    "-   `Alt-/` (Expand word) is also useful to reduce typing\n",
    "\n",
    "    Command history\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `Alt-p` retrieves previous command matching what you have typed.\n",
    "        On macOS use `C-p`.\n",
    "    -   `Alt-n` retrieves next. On macOS use `C-n`.\n",
    "    -   `Return` while on any previous command retrieves that command\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text colors\n",
    "\n",
    "Idle defaults to black on white text, but colors text with special\n",
    "meanings. For the shell, these are shell output, shell error, user\n",
    "output, and user error. For Python code, at the shell prompt or in an\n",
    "editor, these are keywords, builtin class and function names, names\n",
    "following `class` and `def`, strings, and comments. For any text window,\n",
    "these are the cursor (when present), found text (when possible), and\n",
    "selected text.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE also highlights the `soft keywords <soft-keywords>` `match`,\n",
    "`case <match>`, and `_ <wildcard-patterns>` in pattern-matching\n",
    "statements. However, this highlighting is not perfect and will be\n",
    "incorrect in some rare cases, including some `_`-s in `case` patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text coloring is done in the background, so uncolorized text is\n",
    "occasionally visible. To change the color scheme, use the Configure IDLE\n",
    "dialog Highlighting tab. The marking of debugger breakpoint lines in the\n",
    "editor and text in popups and dialogs is not user-configurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Startup and code execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon startup with the `-s` option, IDLE will execute the file referenced\n",
    "by the environment variables `IDLESTARTUP` or `PYTHONSTARTUP`. IDLE\n",
    "first checks for `IDLESTARTUP`; if `IDLESTARTUP` is present the file\n",
    "referenced is run. If `IDLESTARTUP` is not present, IDLE checks for\n",
    "`PYTHONSTARTUP`. Files referenced by these environment variables are\n",
    "convenient places to store functions that are used frequently from the\n",
    "IDLE shell, or for executing import statements to import common modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, `Tk` also loads a startup file if it is present. Note that\n",
    "the Tk file is loaded unconditionally. This additional file is\n",
    "`.Idle.py` and is looked for in the user's home directory. Statements in\n",
    "this file will be executed in the Tk namespace, so this file is not\n",
    "useful for importing functions to be used from IDLE's Python shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command line usage\n",
    "\n",
    "``` none\n",
    "idle.py [-c command] [-d] [-e] [-h] [-i] [-r file] [-s] [-t title] [-] [arg] ...\n",

    "\n",
    "### Startup failure\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE uses a socket to communicate between the IDLE GUI process and the\n",
    "user code execution process. A connection must be established whenever\n",
    "the Shell starts or restarts. (The latter is indicated by a divider line\n",
    "that says 'RESTART'). If the user process fails to connect to the GUI\n",
    "process, it usually displays a `Tk` error box with a 'cannot connect'\n",
    "message that directs the user here. It then exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "One specific connection failure on Unix systems results from\n",
    "misconfigured masquerading rules somewhere in a system's network setup.\n",
    "When IDLE is started from a terminal, one will see a message starting\n",
    "with `** Invalid host:`. The valid value is\n",
    "`127.0.0.1 (idlelib.rpc.LOCALHOST)`. One can diagnose with\n",
    "`tcpconnect -irv 127.0.0.1 6543` in one terminal window and\n",
    "`tcplisten <same args>` in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common cause of failure is a user-written file with the same name as a\n",
    "standard library module, such as *random.py* and *tkinter.py*. When such\n",
    "a file is located in the same directory as a file that is about to be\n",
    "run, IDLE cannot import the stdlib file. The current fix is to rename\n",
    "the user file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though less common than in the past, an antivirus or firewall program\n",
    "may stop the connection. If the program cannot be taught to allow the\n",
    "connection, then it must be turned off for IDLE to work. It is safe to\n",
    "allow this internal connection because no data is visible on external\n",
    "ports. A similar problem is a network mis-configuration that blocks\n",
    "connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python installation issues occasionally stop IDLE: multiple versions can\n",
    "clash, or a single installation might need admin access. If one undo the\n",
    "clash, or cannot or does not want to run as admin, it might be easiest\n",
    "to completely remove Python and start over.\n",
    "\n",
    "A zombie pythonw.exe process could be a problem. On Windows, use Task\n",
    "Manager to check for one and stop it if there is. Sometimes a restart\n",
    "initiated by a program crash or Keyboard Interrupt (control-C) may fail\n",
    "to connect. Dismissing the error box or using Restart Shell on the Shell\n",
    "menu may fix a temporary problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "When IDLE first starts, it attempts to read user configuration files in\n",
    "`~/.idlerc/` (\\~ is one's home directory). If there is a problem, an\n",
    "error message should be displayed. Leaving aside random disk glitches,\n",
    "this can be prevented by never editing the files by hand. Instead, use\n",
    "the configuration dialog, under Options. Once there is an error in a\n",
    "user configuration file, the best solution may be to delete it and start\n",
    "over with the settings dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "If IDLE quits with no message, and it was not started from a console,\n",
    "try starting it from a console or terminal (`python -m idlelib`) and see\n",
    "if this results in an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Unix-based systems with tcl/tk older than `8.6.11` (see `About IDLE`)\n",
    "certain characters of certain fonts can cause a tk failure with a\n",
    "message to the terminal. This can happen either if one starts IDLE to\n",
    "edit a file with such a character or later when entering such a\n",
    "character. If one cannot upgrade tcl/tk, then re-configure IDLE to use a\n",
    "font that works better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running user code\n",
    "\n",
    "With rare exceptions, the result of executing Python code with IDLE is\n",
    "intended to be the same as executing the same code by the default\n",
    "method, directly with Python in a text-mode system console or terminal\n",
    "window. However, the different interface and operation occasionally\n",
    "affect visible results. For instance, `sys.modules` starts with more\n",
    "entries, and `threading.active_count()` returns 2 instead of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, IDLE runs user code in a separate OS process rather than in\n",
    "the user interface process that runs the shell and editor. In the\n",
    "execution process, it replaces `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and\n",
    "`sys.stderr` with objects that get input from and send output to the\n",
    "Shell window. The original values stored in `sys.__stdin__`,\n",
    "`sys.__stdout__`, and `sys.__stderr__` are not touched, but may be\n",
    "`None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending print output from one process to a text widget in another is\n",
    "slower than printing to a system terminal in the same process. This has\n",
    "the most effect when printing multiple arguments, as the string for each\n",
    "argument, each separator, the newline are sent separately. For\n",
    "development, this is usually not a problem, but if one wants to print\n",
    "faster in IDLE, format and join together everything one wants displayed\n",
    "together and then print a single string. Both format strings and\n",
    "`str.join` can help combine fields and lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE's standard stream replacements are not inherited by subprocesses\n",
    "created in the execution process, whether directly by user code or by\n",
    "modules such as multiprocessing. If such subprocess use `input` from\n",
    "sys.stdin or `print` or `write` to sys.stdout or sys.stderr, IDLE should\n",
    "be started in a command line window. The secondary subprocess will then\n",
    "be attached to that window for input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `sys` is reset by user code, such as with `importlib.reload(sys)`,\n",
    "IDLE's changes are lost and input from the keyboard and output to the\n",
    "screen will not work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Shell has the focus, it controls the keyboard and screen. This is\n",
    "normally transparent, but functions that directly access the keyboard\n",
    "and screen will not work. These include system-specific functions that\n",
    "determine whether a key has been pressed and if so, which.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IDLE code running in the execution process adds frames to the call\n",
    "stack that would not be there otherwise. IDLE wraps\n",
    "`sys.getrecursionlimit` and `sys.setrecursionlimit` to reduce the effect\n",
    "of the additional stack frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "When user code raises SystemExit either directly or by calling sys.exit,\n",
    "IDLE returns to a Shell prompt instead of exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User output in Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program outputs text, the result is determined by the\n",
    "corresponding output device. When IDLE executes user code, `sys.stdout`\n",
    "and `sys.stderr` are connected to the display area of IDLE's Shell. Some\n",
    "of its features are inherited from the underlying Tk Text widget. Others\n",
    "are programmed additions. Where it matters, Shell is designed for\n",
    "development rather than production runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Shell never throws away output. A program that sends\n",
    "unlimited output to Shell will eventually fill memory, resulting in a\n",
    "memory error. In contrast, some system text windows only keep the last n\n",
    "lines of output. A Windows console, for instance, keeps a user-settable\n",
    "1 to 9999 lines, with 300 the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Tk Text widget, and hence IDLE's Shell, displays characters\n",
    "(codepoints) in the BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) subset of Unicode.\n",
    "Which characters are displayed with a proper glyph and which with a\n",
    "replacement box depends on the operating system and installed fonts. Tab\n",
    "characters cause the following text to begin after the next tab stop.\n",
    "(They occur every 8 'characters'). Newline characters cause following\n",
    "text to appear on a new line. Other control characters are ignored or\n",
    "displayed as a space, box, or something else, depending on the operating\n",
    "system and font. (Moving the text cursor through such output with arrow\n",
    "keys may exhibit some surprising spacing behavior.) :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> s = 'a\\tb\\a<\\x02><\\r>\\bc\\nd'  # Enter 22 chars.\n",
    "    >>> len(s)\n",
    "    14\n",
    "    >>> s  # Display repr(s)\n",
    "    'a\\tb\\x07<\\x02><\\r>\\x08c\\nd'\n",
    "    >>> print(s, end='')  # Display s as is.\n",
    "    # Result varies by OS and font.  Try it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `repr` function is used for interactive echo of expression values.\n",
    "It returns an altered version of the input string in which control\n",
    "codes, some BMP codepoints, and all non-BMP codepoints are replaced with\n",
    "escape codes. As demonstrated above, it allows one to identify the\n",
    "characters in a string, regardless of how they are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal and error output are generally kept separate (on separate lines)\n",
    "from code input and each other. They each get different highlight\n",
    "colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SyntaxError tracebacks, the normal '^' marking where the error was\n",
    "detected is replaced by coloring the text with an error highlight. When\n",
    "code run from a file causes other exceptions, one may right click on a\n",
    "traceback line to jump to the corresponding line in an IDLE editor. The\n",
    "file will be opened if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shell has a special facility for squeezing output lines down to a\n",
    "'Squeezed text' label. This is done automatically for output over N\n",
    "lines (N = 50 by default). N can be changed in the PyShell section of\n",
    "the General page of the Settings dialog. Output with fewer lines can be\n",
    "squeezed by right clicking on the output. This can be useful lines long\n",
    "enough to slow down scrolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Squeezed output is expanded in place by double-clicking the label. It\n",
    "can also be sent to the clipboard or a separate view window by\n",
    "right-clicking the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing tkinter applications\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE is intentionally different from standard Python in order to\n",
    "facilitate development of tkinter programs. Enter\n",
    "`import tkinter as tk; root = tk.Tk()` in standard Python and nothing\n",
    "appears. Enter the same in IDLE and a tk window appears. In standard\n",
    "Python, one must also enter `root.update()` to see the window. IDLE does\n",
    "the equivalent in the background, about 20 times a second, which is\n",
    "about every 50 milliseconds. Next enter\n",
    "`b = tk.Button(root, text='button'); b.pack()`. Again, nothing visibly\n",
    "changes in standard Python until one enters `root.update()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tkinter programs run `root.mainloop()`, which usually does not\n",
    "return until the tk app is destroyed. If the program is run with\n",
    "`python -i` or from an IDLE editor, a `>>>` shell prompt does not appear\n",
    "until `mainloop()` returns, at which time there is nothing left to\n",
    "interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running a tkinter program from an IDLE editor, one can comment out\n",
    "the mainloop call. One then gets a shell prompt immediately and can\n",
    "interact with the live application. One just has to remember to\n",
    "re-enable the mainloop call when running in standard Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running without a subprocess\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, IDLE executes user code in a separate subprocess via a\n",
    "socket, which uses the internal loopback interface. This connection is\n",
    "not externally visible and no data is sent to or received from the\n",
    "internet. If firewall software complains anyway, you can ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the attempt to make the socket connection fails, Idle will notify\n",
    "you. Such failures are sometimes transient, but if persistent, the\n",
    "problem may be either a firewall blocking the connection or\n",
    "misconfiguration of a particular system. Until the problem is fixed, one\n",
    "can run Idle with the -n command line switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "If IDLE is started with the -n command line switch it will run in a\n",
    "single process and will not create the subprocess which runs the RPC\n",
    "Python execution server. This can be useful if Python cannot create the\n",
    "subprocess or the RPC socket interface on your platform. However, in\n",
    "this mode user code is not isolated from IDLE itself. Also, the\n",
    "environment is not restarted when Run/Run Module (F5) is selected. If\n",
    "your code has been modified, you must reload() the affected modules and\n",
    "re-import any specific items (e.g. from foo import baz) if the changes\n",
    "are to take effect. For these reasons, it is preferable to run IDLE with\n",
    "the default subprocess if at all possible.\n",
