    "This module provides access to mathematical functions for complex\n",
    "numbers. The functions in this module accept integers, floating-point\n",
    "numbers or complex numbers as arguments. They will also accept any\n",
    "Python object that has either a `__complex__` or a `__float__` method:\n",

    "result lies in the range \\[-*π*, *π*\\], and the branch cut for this\n",
    "operation lies along the negative real axis, continuous from above. On\n",
    "systems with support for signed zeros (which includes most systems in\n",
