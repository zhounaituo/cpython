    "the functionality is provided by the *cte* parameter of the\n",

    "\n",
    "This module is deprecated in Python 3. The functions provided here\n",
    "should not be called explicitly since the `~email.mime.text.MIMEText`\n",
    "class sets the content type and CTE header using the *\\_subtype* and\n",

    "When creating `~email.message.Message` objects from scratch, you often\n",

    "The `email` package provides some convenient encoders in its `encoders`\n",
    "module. These encoders are actually used by the\n",
    "`~email.mime.audio.MIMEAudio` and `~email.mime.image.MIMEImage` class\n",
    "constructors to provide default encodings. All encoder functions take\n",
    "exactly one argument, the message object to encode. They usually extract\n",
    "the payload, encode it, and reset the payload to this newly encoded\n",
    "value. They should also set the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header as\n",
    "appropriate.\n",
    "\n",

    "but contains a few unprintable characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "encode_base64(msg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Encodes the payload into base64 form and sets the\n",
    "`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header to `base64`. This is a good encoding\n",
    "to use when most of your payload is unprintable data since it is a more\n",
    "compact form than quoted-printable. The drawback of base64 encoding is\n",
    "that it renders the text non-human readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "encode_7or8bit(msg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't actually modify the message's payload, but it does set the\n",

    "appropriate, based on the payload data.\n",
    "\n",
    "encode_noop(msg)\n",
