    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using an\n",
    "API similar to the `threading` module. The `multiprocessing` package\n",
    "offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the\n",
    "`Global Interpreter Lock <global interpreter lock>` by using\n",
    "subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the `multiprocessing`\n",
    "module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a\n",
    "given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `multiprocessing` module also introduces APIs which do not have\n",
    "analogs in the `threading` module. A prime example of this is the\n",
    "`~multiprocessing.pool.Pool` object which offers a convenient means of\n",
    "parallelizing the execution of a function across multiple input values,\n",
    "distributing the input data across processes (data parallelism). The\n",
    "following example demonstrates the common practice of defining such\n",
    "functions in a module so that child processes can successfully import\n",
    "that module. This basic example of data parallelism using\n",
    "`~multiprocessing.pool.Pool`, :\n",
    "\n",
    "    from multiprocessing import Pool\n",
    "\n",
    "    def f(x):\n",
    "        return x*x\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        with Pool(5) as p:\n",
    "            print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))\n",
    "\n",
    "will print to standard output :\n",

    "    [1, 4, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `Process` class\n",
    "\n",
    "In `multiprocessing`, processes are spawned by creating a `Process`\n",
    "object and then calling its `~Process.start` method. `Process` follows\n",
    "the API of `threading.Thread`. A trivial example of a multiprocess\n",
    "program is :\n",
    "\n",
    "    from multiprocessing import Process\n",
    "\n",
    "    def f(name):\n",
    "        print('hello', name)\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))\n",
    "        p.start()\n",
    "        p.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "To show the individual process IDs involved, here is an expanded\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from multiprocessing import Process\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "\n",
    "    def info(title):\n",
    "        print(title)\n",
    "        print('module name:', __name__)\n",
    "        print('parent process:', os.getppid())\n",
    "        print('process id:', os.getpid())\n",
    "\n",
    "    def f(name):\n",
    "        info('function f')\n",
    "        print('hello', name)\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        info('main line')\n",
    "        p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))\n",
    "        p.start()\n",
    "        p.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "For an explanation of why the `if __name__ == '__main__'` part is\n",
    "necessary, see `multiprocessing-programming`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contexts and start methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the platform, `multiprocessing` supports three ways to\n",
    "start a process. These *start methods* are\n",
    "\n",
    "> *spawn*  \n",
    "> The parent process starts a fresh python interpreter process. The\n",
    "> child process will only inherit those resources necessary to run the\n",
    "> process object's `~Process.run` method. In particular, unnecessary\n",
    "> file descriptors and handles from the parent process will not be\n",
    "> inherited. Starting a process using this method is rather slow\n",
    "> compared to using *fork* or *forkserver*.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Available on Unix and Windows. The default on Windows and macOS.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *fork*  \n",
    "> The parent process uses `os.fork` to fork the Python interpreter. The\n",
    "> child process, when it begins, is effectively identical to the parent\n",
    "> process. All resources of the parent are inherited by the child\n",
    "> process. Note that safely forking a multithreaded process is\n",
    "> problematic.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Available on Unix only. The default on Unix.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *forkserver*  \n",
    "> When the program starts and selects the *forkserver* start method, a\n",
    "> server process is started. From then on, whenever a new process is\n",
    "> needed, the parent process connects to the server and requests that it\n",
    "> fork a new process. The fork server process is single threaded so it\n",
    "> is safe for it to use `os.fork`. No unnecessary resources are\n",
    "> inherited.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Available on Unix platforms which support passing file descriptors\n",
    "> over Unix pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.8\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS, the *spawn* start method is now the default. The *fork* start\n",
    "method should be considered unsafe as it can lead to crashes of the\n",
    "subprocess. See `33725`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 *spawn* added on all unix platforms, and *forkserver* added for some\n",
    "unix platforms. Child processes no longer inherit all of the parents\n",
    "inheritable handles on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Unix using the *spawn* or *forkserver* start methods will also start\n",
    "a *resource tracker* process which tracks the unlinked named system\n",
    "resources (such as named semaphores or\n",
    "`~multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory` objects) created by\n",
    "processes of the program. When all processes have exited the resource\n",
    "tracker unlinks any remaining tracked object. Usually there should be\n",
    "none, but if a process was killed by a signal there may be some \"leaked\"\n",
    "resources. (Neither leaked semaphores nor shared memory segments will be\n",
    "automatically unlinked until the next reboot. This is problematic for\n",
    "both objects because the system allows only a limited number of named\n",
    "semaphores, and shared memory segments occupy some space in the main\n",
    "memory.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To select a start method you use the `set_start_method` in the\n",
    "`if __name__ == '__main__'` clause of the main module. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import multiprocessing as mp\n",
    "\n",
    "    def foo(q):\n",
    "        q.put('hello')\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        mp.set_start_method('spawn')\n",
    "        q = mp.Queue()\n",
    "        p = mp.Process(target=foo, args=(q,))\n",
    "        p.start()\n",
    "        print(q.get())\n",
    "        p.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "`set_start_method` should not be used more than once in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use `get_context` to obtain a context object.\n",
    "Context objects have the same API as the multiprocessing module, and\n",
    "allow one to use multiple start methods in the same program. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    import multiprocessing as mp\n",
    "\n",
    "    def foo(q):\n",
    "        q.put('hello')\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        ctx = mp.get_context('spawn')\n",
    "        q = ctx.Queue()\n",
    "        p = ctx.Process(target=foo, args=(q,))\n",
    "        p.start()\n",
    "        print(q.get())\n",
    "        p.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that objects related to one context may not be compatible with\n",
    "processes for a different context. In particular, locks created using\n",
    "the *fork* context cannot be passed to processes started using the\n",
    "*spawn* or *forkserver* start methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A library which wants to use a particular start method should probably\n",
    "use `get_context` to avoid interfering with the choice of the library\n",
    "user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "The `'spawn'` and `'forkserver'` start methods cannot currently be used\n",
    "with \"frozen\" executables (i.e., binaries produced by packages like\n",
    "**PyInstaller** and **cx_Freeze**) on Unix. The `'fork'` start method\n",
    "does work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exchanging objects between processes\n",
    "\n",
    "`multiprocessing` supports two types of communication channel between\n",
    "processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queues**\n",
    "\n",
    "> The `Queue` class is a near clone of `queue.Queue`. For example:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">     from multiprocessing import Process, Queue\n",
    ">\n",
    ">     def f(q):\n",
    ">         q.put([42, None, 'hello'])\n",
    ">\n",
    ">     if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    ">         q = Queue()\n",
    ">         p = Process(target=f, args=(q,))\n",
    ">         p.start()\n",
    ">         print(q.get())    # prints \"[42, None, 'hello']\"\n",
    ">         p.join()\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Queues are thread and process safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipes**\n",
    "\n",
    "> The `Pipe` function returns a pair of connection objects connected by\n",
    "> a pipe which by default is duplex (two-way). For example:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">     from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe\n",
    ">\n",
    ">     def f(conn):\n",
    ">         conn.send([42, None, 'hello'])\n",
    ">         conn.close()\n",
    ">\n",
    ">     if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    ">         parent_conn, child_conn = Pipe()\n",
    ">         p = Process(target=f, args=(child_conn,))\n",
    ">         p.start()\n",
    ">         print(parent_conn.recv())   # prints \"[42, None, 'hello']\"\n",
    ">         p.join()\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The two connection objects returned by `Pipe` represent the two ends\n",
    "> of the pipe. Each connection object has `~Connection.send` and\n",
    "> `~Connection.recv` methods (among others). Note that data in a pipe\n",
    "> may become corrupted if two processes (or threads) try to read from or\n",
    "> write to the *same* end of the pipe at the same time. Of course there\n",
    "> is no risk of corruption from processes using different ends of the\n",
    "> pipe at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronization between processes\n",
    "\n",
    "`multiprocessing` contains equivalents of all the synchronization\n",
    "primitives from `threading`. For instance one can use a lock to ensure\n",
    "that only one process prints to standard output at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from multiprocessing import Process, Lock\n",
    "\n",
    "    def f(l, i):\n",
    "        l.acquire()\n",
    "        try:\n",

    "            Process(target=f, args=(lock, num)).start()\n",
    "\n",
    "Without using the lock output from the different processes is liable to\n",
    "get all mixed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharing state between processes\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, when doing concurrent programming it is usually best\n",
    "to avoid using shared state as far as possible. This is particularly\n",
    "true when using multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you really do need to use some shared data then\n",
    "`multiprocessing` provides a couple of ways of doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared memory**\n",
    "\n",

    ">     [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The `'d'` and `'i'` arguments used when creating `num` and `arr` are\n",
    "> typecodes of the kind used by the `array` module: `'d'` indicates a\n",
    "> double precision float and `'i'` indicates a signed integer. These\n",
    "> shared objects will be process and thread-safe.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For more flexibility in using shared memory one can use the\n",

    "*referent* of the proxy. Multiple proxy objects may have the same\n",
    "referent.\n",
    "\n",
    "A proxy object has methods which invoke corresponding methods of its\n",
    "referent (although not every method of the referent will necessarily be\n",
    "available through the proxy). In this way, a proxy can be used just like\n",

    "the referent, whereas applying `repr` will return the representation of\n",
    "the proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important feature of proxy objects is that they are picklable so they\n",
    "can be passed between processes. As such, a referent can contain\n",
    "`multiprocessing-proxy_objects`. This permits nesting of these managed\n",
    "lists, dicts, and other `multiprocessing-proxy_objects`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> a = manager.list() \\>\\>\\> b = manager.list() \\>\\>\\> a.append(b)\n",

    "by any `~multiprocessing.Process` object that the current process\n",
    "creates. This means that (by default) all processes of a multi-process\n",
    "program will share a single authentication key which can be used when\n",

    "multiprocessing.pool\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the `Pool` function provided by `multiprocessing.dummy`\n",
    "returns an instance of `ThreadPool`, which is a subclass of `Pool` that\n",
    "supports all the same method calls but uses a pool of worker threads\n",
    "rather than worker processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread pool object which controls a pool of worker threads to which\n",
    "jobs can be submitted. `ThreadPool` instances are fully interface\n",

    "> other libraries, including `asyncio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain guidelines and idioms which should be adhered to when\n",
    "using `multiprocessing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All start methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The following applies to all start methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid shared state\n",
    "\n",
    "> As far as possible one should try to avoid shifting large amounts of\n",
    "> data between processes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is probably best to stick to using queues or pipes for\n",
    "> communication between processes rather than using the lower level\n",
    "> synchronization primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Picklability\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ensure that the arguments to the methods of proxies are picklable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread safety of proxies\n",
    "\n",
    "> Do not use a proxy object from more than one thread unless you protect\n",
    "> it with a lock.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> (There is never a problem with different processes using the *same*\n",
    "> proxy.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining zombie processes\n",
    "\n",
    "> On Unix when a process finishes but has not been joined it becomes a\n",
    "> zombie. There should never be very many because each time a new\n",
    "> process starts (or `~multiprocessing.active_children` is called) all\n",
    "> completed processes which have not yet been joined will be joined.\n",
    "> Also calling a finished process's\n",
    "> `Process.is_alive <multiprocessing.Process.is_alive>` will join the\n",
    "> process. Even so it is probably good practice to explicitly join all\n",
    "> the processes that you start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better to inherit than pickle/unpickle\n",
    "\n",
    "> When using the *spawn* or *forkserver* start methods many types from\n",
    "> `multiprocessing` need to be picklable so that child processes can use\n",
    "> them. However, one should generally avoid sending shared objects to\n",
    "> other processes using pipes or queues. Instead you should arrange the\n",
    "> program so that a process which needs access to a shared resource\n",
    "> created elsewhere can inherit it from an ancestor process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid terminating processes\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using the `Process.terminate <multiprocessing.Process.terminate>`\n",
    "> method to stop a process is liable to cause any shared resources (such\n",
    "> as locks, semaphores, pipes and queues) currently being used by the\n",
    "> process to become broken or unavailable to other processes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Therefore it is probably best to only consider using\n",
    "> `Process.terminate <multiprocessing.Process.terminate>` on processes\n",
    "> which never use any shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining processes that use queues\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bear in mind that a process that has put items in a queue will wait\n",
    "> before terminating until all the buffered items are fed by the\n",
    "> \"feeder\" thread to the underlying pipe. (The child process can call\n",
    "> the\n",
    "> `Queue.cancel_join_thread <multiprocessing.Queue.cancel_join_thread>`\n",
    "> method of the queue to avoid this behaviour.)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This means that whenever you use a queue you need to make sure that\n",
    "> all items which have been put on the queue will eventually be removed\n",
    "> before the process is joined. Otherwise you cannot be sure that\n",
    "> processes which have put items on the queue will terminate. Remember\n",
    "> also that non-daemonic processes will be joined automatically.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An example which will deadlock is the following:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python3\n",
    "> from multiprocessing import Process, Queue\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def f(q):\n",
    ">     q.put('X' * 1000000)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    ">     queue = Queue()\n",
    ">     p = Process(target=f, args=(queue,))\n",
    ">     p.start()\n",
    ">     p.join()                    # this deadlocks\n",
    ">     obj = queue.get()\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A fix here would be to swap the last two lines (or simply remove the\n",
    "> `p.join()` line).\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicitly pass resources to child processes\n",
    "\n",
    "> On Unix using the *fork* start method, a child process can make use of\n",
    "> a shared resource created in a parent process using a global resource.\n",
    "> However, it is better to pass the object as an argument to the\n",
    "> constructor for the child process.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Apart from making the code (potentially) compatible with Windows and\n",
    "> the other start methods this also ensures that as long as the child\n",
    "> process is still alive the object will not be garbage collected in the\n",
    "> parent process. This might be important if some resource is freed when\n",
    "> the object is garbage collected in the parent process.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> So for instance :\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python3\n",
    "> from multiprocessing import Process, Lock\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def f():\n",
    ">     ... do something using \"lock\" ...\n",
    ">\n",
    "> if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    ">     lock = Lock()\n",
    ">     for i in range(10):\n",
    ">         Process(target=f).start()\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> should be rewritten as :\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python3\n",
    "> from multiprocessing import Process, Lock\n",
    ">\n",
    "> def f(l):\n",
    ">     ... do something using \"l\" ...\n",
    ">\n",
    "> if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    ">     lock = Lock()\n",
    ">     for i in range(10):\n",
    ">         Process(target=f, args=(lock,)).start()\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Beware of replacing `sys.stdin` with a \"file like object\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> `multiprocessing` originally unconditionally called:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python3\n",
    "> os.close(sys.stdin.fileno())\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> in the `multiprocessing.Process._bootstrap` method --- this resulted\n",
    "> in issues with processes-in-processes. This has been changed to:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python3\n",
    "> sys.stdin.close()\n",
    "> sys.stdin = open(os.open(os.devnull, os.O_RDONLY), closefd=False)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Which solves the fundamental issue of processes colliding with each\n",
    "> other resulting in a bad file descriptor error, but introduces a\n",
    "> potential danger to applications which replace `sys.stdin` with a\n",
    "> \"file-like object\" with output buffering. This danger is that if\n",
    "> multiple processes call `~io.IOBase.close()` on this file-like object,\n",
    "> it could result in the same data being flushed to the object multiple\n",
    "> times, resulting in corruption.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you write a file-like object and implement your own caching, you\n",
    "> can make it fork-safe by storing the pid whenever you append to the\n",
    "> cache, and discarding the cache when the pid changes. For example:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` python3\n",
    "> @property\n",
    "> def cache(self):\n",
    ">     pid = os.getpid()\n",
    ">     if pid != self._pid:\n",
    ">         self._pid = pid\n",
    ">         self._cache = []\n",
    ">     return self._cache\n",
