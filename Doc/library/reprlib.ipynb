    "\n",
    "The `reprlib` module provides a means for producing object\n",
    "representations with limits on the size of the resulting strings. This\n",
    "is used in the Python debugger and may be useful in other contexts as\n",
    "well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module provides a class, an instance, and a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class which provides formatting services useful in implementing\n",
    "functions similar to the built-in `repr`; size limits for different\n",
    "object types are added to avoid the generation of representations which\n",
    "are excessively long.\n",
    "\n",
    "aRepr\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an instance of `Repr` which is used to provide the `.repr`\n",
    "function described below. Changing the attributes of this object will\n",
    "affect the size limits used by `.repr` and the Python debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "repr(obj)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the `~Repr.repr` method of `aRepr`. It returns a string similar\n",
    "to that returned by the built-in function of the same name, but with\n",
    "limits on most sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to size-limiting tools, the module also provides a decorator\n",
    "for detecting recursive calls to `__repr__` and substituting a\n",
