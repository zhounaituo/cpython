    "\n",
    "-   `FORMAT_RAW`: A raw data stream, not using sequences format.  \n",
    "    This format specifier does not support integrity checks, and\n",

    "    `LZMADecompressor`).\n",

    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being more CPU-intensive, compression with higher presets\n",
