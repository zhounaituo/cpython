    "The `~shlex.shlex` class makes it easy to write lexical analyzers for\n",
    "simple syntaxes resembling that of the Unix shell. This will often be\n",
    "useful for writing minilanguages, (for example, in run control files for\n",
    "Python applications) or for parsing quoted strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `shlex` module defines the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "split(s, comments=False, posix=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the string *s* using shell-like syntax. If *comments* is `False`\n",

    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `split` function instantiates a `~shlex.shlex` instance,\n",

    "\n",
    "The `shlex` module defines the following class:\n",
    "\n",
    "A `~shlex.shlex` instance or subclass instance is a lexical analyzer\n",
    "object. The initialization argument, if present, specifies where to read\n",
    "characters from. It must be a file-/stream-like object with\n",
    "`~io.TextIOBase.read` and `~io.TextIOBase.readline` methods, or a\n",
    "string. If no argument is given, input will be taken from `sys.stdin`.\n",
    "The second optional argument is a filename string, which sets the\n",
    "initial value of the `~shlex.infile` attribute. If the *instream*\n",
    "argument is omitted or equal to `sys.stdin`, this second argument\n",
    "defaults to \"stdin\". The *posix* argument defines the operational mode:\n",
    "when *posix* is not true (default), the `~shlex.shlex` instance will\n",
    "operate in compatibility mode. When operating in POSIX mode,\n",
    "`~shlex.shlex` will try to be as close as possible to the POSIX shell\n",
    "parsing rules. The *punctuation_chars* argument provides a way to make\n",
    "the behaviour even closer to how real shells parse. This can take a\n",
    "number of values: the default value, `False`, preserves the behaviour\n",
    "seen under Python 3.5 and earlier. If set to `True`, then parsing of the\n",
    "characters `();<>|&` is changed: any run of these characters (considered\n",
    "punctuation characters) is returned as a single token. If set to a\n",
    "non-empty string of characters, those characters will be used as the\n",
    "punctuation characters. Any characters in the `wordchars` attribute that\n",
    "appear in *punctuation_chars* will be removed from `wordchars`. See\n",
    "`improved-shell-compatibility` for more information. *punctuation_chars*\n",
    "can be set only upon `~shlex.shlex` instance creation and can't be\n",

    "shlex.get_token()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a token. If tokens have been stacked using `push_token`, pop a\n",
    "token off the stack. Otherwise, read one from the input stream. If\n",

    "documented here only for the sake of completeness.)\n",

    "shlex.sourcehook(filename)\n",
    "\n",
    "When `~shlex.shlex` detects a source request (see `source` below) this\n",
    "method is given the following token as argument, and expected to return\n",
    "a tuple consisting of a filename and an open file-like object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, this method first strips any quotes off the argument. If the\n",
    "result is an absolute pathname, or there was no previous source request\n",
    "in effect, or the previous source was a stream (such as `sys.stdin`),\n",
    "the result is left alone. Otherwise, if the result is a relative\n",
    "pathname, the directory part of the name of the file immediately before\n",
    "it on the source inclusion stack is prepended (this behavior is like the\n",
    "way the C preprocessor handles `#include \"file.h\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the manipulations is treated as a filename, and returned\n",
    "as the first component of the tuple, with `open` called on it to yield\n",
    "the second component. (Note: this is the reverse of the order of\n",
    "arguments in instance initialization!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This hook is exposed so that you can use it to implement directory\n",
    "search paths, addition of file extensions, and other namespace hacks.\n",
    "There is no corresponding 'close' hook, but a shlex instance will call\n",
    "the `~io.IOBase.close` method of the sourced input stream when it\n",

    "    (`\"Do\"Not\"Separate\"` is parsed as the single word `DoNotSeparate`);\n",
    "-   Non-quoted escape characters (e.g. `'\\'`) preserve the literal value\n",

    "-   Enclosing characters in quotes which are not part of\n",
    "    `~shlex.escapedquotes` (e.g. `\"'\"`) preserve the literal value of\n",

    "\n",
    "## Improved Compatibility with Shells\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6\n",
    "\n",
    "The `shlex` class provides compatibility with the parsing performed by\n",
    "common Unix shells like `bash`, `dash`, and `sh`. To take advantage of\n",
    "this compatibility, specify the `punctuation_chars` argument in the\n",
    "constructor. This defaults to `False`, which preserves pre-3.6\n",
    "behaviour. However, if it is set to `True`, then parsing of the\n",
    "characters `();<>|&` is changed: any run of these characters is returned\n",
    "as a single token. While this is short of a full parser for shells\n",
    "(which would be out of scope for the standard library, given the\n",
    "multiplicity of shells out there), it does allow you to perform\n",
    "processing of command lines more easily than you could otherwise. To\n",
    "illustrate, you can see the difference in the following snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\>\\>\\> import shlex \\>\\>\\> text = \"a && b; c && d \\|\\| e; f \\>'abc';\n",
    "(def \"ghi\")\" \\>\\>\\> s = shlex.shlex(text, posix=True) \\>\\>\\>\n",
    "s.whitespace_split = True \\>\\>\\> list(s) \\['a', '&&', 'b;', 'c', '&&',\n",
    "'d', '\\|\\|', 'e', ';', 'f', '\\>', 'abc', ';', '(', 'def', 'ghi', ')'\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, tokens will be returned which are not valid for shells, and\n",
    "you'll need to implement your own error checks on the returned tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of passing `True` as the value for the punctuation_chars\n",
    "parameter, you can pass a string with specific characters, which will be\n",
    "used to determine which characters constitute punctuation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import shlex\n",
    "    >>> s = shlex.shlex(\"a && b || c\", punctuation_chars=\"|\")\n",
    "    >>> list(s)\n",
    "    ['a', '&', '&', 'b', '||', 'c']\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "When `punctuation_chars` is specified, the `~shlex.wordchars` attribute\n",
    "is augmented with the characters `~-./*?=`. That is because these\n",
    "characters can appear in file names (including wildcards) and\n",
    "command-line arguments (e.g. `--color=auto`). Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import shlex\n",
    "    >>> s = shlex.shlex('~/a && b-c --color=auto || d *.py?',\n",
    "\n",
    "... punctuation_chars=True) \\>\\>\\> list(s) \\['\\~/a', '&&', 'b-c',\n",
    "'--color=auto', '\\|\\|', 'd', '\\*.py?'\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to match the shell as closely as possible, it is recommended to\n",
    "always use `posix` and `~shlex.whitespace_split` when using\n",
    "`~shlex.punctuation_chars`, which will negate `~shlex.wordchars`\n",
    "entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "For best effect, `punctuation_chars` should be set in conjunction with\n",
    "`posix=True`. (Note that `posix=False` is the default for\n",
    "`~shlex.shlex`.)"
