    "# `socketserver` --- A framework for network servers\n",
    "\n",
    "socketserver\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source code:** `Lib/socketserver.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `socketserver` module simplifies the task of writing network\n",
    "servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four basic concrete server classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses the internet TCP protocol, which provides for continuous\n",
    "streams of data between the client and server. If *bind_and_activate* is\n",
    "true, the constructor automatically attempts to invoke\n",
    "`~BaseServer.server_bind` and `~BaseServer.server_activate`. The other\n",
    "parameters are passed to the `BaseServer` base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses datagrams, which are discrete packets of information that may\n",
    "arrive out of order or be lost while in transit. The parameters are the\n",
    "same as for `TCPServer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These more infrequently used classes are similar to the TCP and UDP\n",
    "classes, but use Unix domain sockets; they're not available on non-Unix\n",
    "platforms. The parameters are the same as for `TCPServer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four classes process requests `synchronously`; each request must\n",
    "be completed before the next request can be started. This isn't suitable\n",
    "if each request takes a long time to complete, because it requires a lot\n",
    "of computation, or because it returns a lot of data which the client is\n",
    "slow to process. The solution is to create a separate process or thread\n",
    "to handle each request; the `ForkingMixIn` and `ThreadingMixIn` mix-in\n",
    "classes can be used to support asynchronous behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a server requires several steps. First, you must create a\n",
    "request handler class by subclassing the `BaseRequestHandler` class and\n",
    "overriding its `~BaseRequestHandler.handle` method; this method will\n",
    "process incoming requests. Second, you must instantiate one of the\n",
    "server classes, passing it the server's address and the request handler\n",
    "class. It is recommended to use the server in a `with` statement. Then\n",
    "call the `~BaseServer.handle_request` or `~BaseServer.serve_forever`\n",
    "method of the server object to process one or many requests. Finally,\n",
    "call `~BaseServer.server_close` to close the socket (unless you used a\n",
    "`!with` statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "When inheriting from `ThreadingMixIn` for threaded connection behavior,\n",
    "you should explicitly declare how you want your threads to behave on an\n",
    "abrupt shutdown. The `ThreadingMixIn` class defines an attribute\n",
    "*daemon_threads*, which indicates whether or not the server should wait\n",
    "for thread termination. You should set the flag explicitly if you would\n",
    "like threads to behave autonomously; the default is `False`, meaning\n",
    "that Python will not exit until all threads created by `ThreadingMixIn`\n",
    "have exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Server classes have the same external methods and attributes, no matter\n",
    "what network protocol they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Server Creation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five classes in an inheritance diagram, four of which\n",
    "represent synchronous servers of four types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    +------------+\n",
    "    | BaseServer |\n",
    "    +------------+\n",
    "          |\n",
    "          v\n",
    "    +-----------+        +------------------+\n",
    "    | TCPServer |------->| UnixStreamServer |\n",
    "    +-----------+        +------------------+\n",
    "          |\n",
    "          v\n",
    "    +-----------+        +--------------------+\n",
    "    | UDPServer |------->| UnixDatagramServer |\n",
    "    +-----------+        +--------------------+\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `UnixDatagramServer` derives from `UDPServer`, not from\n",
    "`UnixStreamServer` --- the only difference between an IP and a Unix\n",
    "stream server is the address family, which is simply repeated in both\n",
    "Unix server classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking and threading versions of each type of server can be created\n",
    "using these mix-in classes. For instance, `ThreadingUDPServer` is\n",
    "created as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class ThreadingUDPServer(ThreadingMixIn, UDPServer):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "The mix-in class comes first, since it overrides a method defined in\n",
    "`UDPServer`. Setting the various attributes also changes the behavior of\n",
    "the underlying server mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ForkingMixIn` and the Forking classes mentioned below are only\n",
    "available on POSIX platforms that support `~os.fork`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`socketserver.ForkingMixIn.server_close` waits until all child processes\n",
    "complete, except if `socketserver.ForkingMixIn.block_on_close` attribute\n",
    "is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "`socketserver.ThreadingMixIn.server_close` waits until all non-daemon\n",
    "threads complete, except if `socketserver.ThreadingMixIn.block_on_close`\n",
    "attribute is false. Use daemonic threads by setting\n",
    "`ThreadingMixIn.daemon_threads` to `True` to not wait until threads\n",
    "complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7\n",
    "\n",
    "`socketserver.ForkingMixIn.server_close` and\n",
    "`socketserver.ThreadingMixIn.server_close` now waits until all child\n",
    "processes and non-daemonic threads complete. Add a new\n",
    "`socketserver.ForkingMixIn.block_on_close` class attribute to opt-in for\n",
    "the pre-3.7 behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "These classes are pre-defined using the mix-in classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a service, you must derive a class from\n",
    "`BaseRequestHandler` and redefine its `~BaseRequestHandler.handle`\n",
    "method. You can then run various versions of the service by combining\n",
    "one of the server classes with your request handler class. The request\n",
    "handler class must be different for datagram or stream services. This\n",
    "can be hidden by using the handler subclasses `StreamRequestHandler` or\n",
    "`DatagramRequestHandler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you still have to use your head! For instance, it makes no\n",
    "sense to use a forking server if the service contains state in memory\n",
    "that can be modified by different requests, since the modifications in\n",
    "the child process would never reach the initial state kept in the parent\n",
    "process and passed to each child. In this case, you can use a threading\n",
    "server, but you will probably have to use locks to protect the integrity\n",
    "of the shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you are building an HTTP server where all data is\n",
    "stored externally (for instance, in the file system), a synchronous\n",
    "class will essentially render the service \"deaf\" while one request is\n",
    "being handled --which may be for a very long time if a client is slow to\n",
    "receive all the data it has requested. Here a threading or forking\n",
    "server is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it may be appropriate to process part of a request\n",
    "synchronously, but to finish processing in a forked child depending on\n",
    "the request data. This can be implemented by using a synchronous server\n",
    "and doing an explicit fork in the request handler class\n",
    "`~BaseRequestHandler.handle` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to handling multiple simultaneous requests in an\n",
    "environment that supports neither threads nor `~os.fork` (or where these\n",
    "are too expensive or inappropriate for the service) is to maintain an\n",
    "explicit table of partially finished requests and to use `selectors` to\n",
    "decide which request to work on next (or whether to handle a new\n",
    "incoming request). This is particularly important for stream services\n",
    "where each client can potentially be connected for a long time (if\n",
    "threads or subprocesses cannot be used). See `asyncore` for another way\n",
    "to manage this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Server Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the superclass of all Server objects in the module. It defines\n",
    "the interface, given below, but does not implement most of the methods,\n",
    "which is done in subclasses. The two parameters are stored in the\n",
    "respective `server_address` and `RequestHandlerClass` attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "fileno()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an integer file descriptor for the socket on which the server is\n",
    "listening. This function is most commonly passed to `selectors`, to\n",
    "allow monitoring multiple servers in the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "handle_request()\n",
    "\n",
    "Process a single request. This function calls the following methods in\n",
    "order: `get_request`, `verify_request`, and `process_request`. If the\n",
    "user-provided `~BaseRequestHandler.handle` method of the handler class\n",
    "raises an exception, the server's `handle_error` method will be called.\n",
    "If no request is received within `timeout` seconds, `handle_timeout`\n",
    "will be called and `handle_request` will return.\n",
    "\n",
    "serve_forever(poll_interval=0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle requests until an explicit `shutdown` request. Poll for shutdown\n",
    "every *poll_interval* seconds. Ignores the `timeout` attribute. It also\n",
    "calls `service_actions`, which may be used by a subclass or mixin to\n",
    "provide actions specific to a given service. For example, the\n",
    "`ForkingMixIn` class uses `service_actions` to clean up zombie child\n",
    "processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Added `service_actions` call to the `serve_forever` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "service_actions()\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called in the `serve_forever` loop. This method can be\n",
    "overridden by subclasses or mixin classes to perform actions specific to\n",
    "a given service, such as cleanup actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "shutdown()\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell the `serve_forever` loop to stop and wait until it does. `shutdown`\n",

    "\n",
    "server_address\n",
    "\n",
    "The address on which the server is listening. The format of addresses\n",
    "varies depending on the protocol family; see the documentation for the\n",
    "`socket` module for details. For internet protocols, this is a tuple\n",
    "containing a string giving the address, and an integer port number:\n",
    "`('127.0.0.1', 80)`, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "socket\n",
    "\n",
    "The socket object on which the server will listen for incoming requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server classes support the following class variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "allow_reuse_address\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the server will allow the reuse of an address. This defaults to\n",
    "`False`, and can be set in subclasses to change the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "request_queue_size\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the request queue. If it takes a long time to process a\n",
    "single request, any requests that arrive while the server is busy are\n",
    "placed into a queue, up to `request_queue_size` requests. Once the queue\n",
    "is full, further requests from clients will get a \"Connection denied\"\n",
    "error. The default value is usually 5, but this can be overridden by\n",
    "subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "socket_type\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of socket used by the server; `socket.SOCK_STREAM` and\n",

    "\n",
    "timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeout duration, measured in seconds, or `None` if no timeout is\n",
    "desired. If `handle_request` receives no incoming requests within the\n",
    "timeout period, the `handle_timeout` method is called.\n",

    "process_request(request, client_address)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calls `finish_request` to create an instance of the\n",

    "`ThreadingMixIn` classes do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "server_activate()\n",
    "\n",
    "Called by the server's constructor to activate the server. The default\n",
    "behavior for a TCP server just invokes `~socket.socket.listen` on the\n",
    "server's socket. May be overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "server_bind()\n",

    "\n",
    "Must return a Boolean value; if the value is `True`, the request will be\n",
    "processed, and if it's `False`, the request will be denied. This\n",
    "function can be overridden to implement access controls for a server.\n",
    "The default implementation always returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 Support for the `context manager` protocol was added. Exiting the\n",
    "context manager is equivalent to calling `server_close`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request Handler Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the superclass of all request handler objects. It defines the\n",
    "interface, given below. A concrete request handler subclass must define\n",
    "a new `handle` method, and can override any of the other methods. A new\n",
    "instance of the subclass is created for each request.\n",
    "\n",

    "handle()\n",
    "\n",
    "This function must do all the work required to service a request. The\n",
    "default implementation does nothing. Several instance attributes are\n",
    "available to it; the request is available as `self.request`; the client\n",
    "address as `self.client_address`; and the server instance as\n",
    "`self.server`, in case it needs access to per-server information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of `self.request` is different for datagram or stream services.\n",

    "\n",
    "finish()\n",
    "\n",
    "Called after the `handle` method to perform any clean-up actions\n",

    "\n",
    "These `BaseRequestHandler` subclasses override the\n",
    "`~BaseRequestHandler.setup` and `~BaseRequestHandler.finish` methods,\n",
    "and provide `self.rfile` and `self.wfile` attributes. The `self.rfile`\n",
    "and `self.wfile` attributes can be read or written, respectively, to get\n",
    "the request data or return data to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rfile` attributes of both classes support the `io.BufferedIOBase`\n",
    "readable interface, and `DatagramRequestHandler.wfile` supports the\n",
    "`io.BufferedIOBase` writable interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 `StreamRequestHandler.wfile` also supports the `io.BufferedIOBase`\n",
