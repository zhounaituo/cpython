    "This module is part of the legacy (`Compat32`) email API. In the current\n",
    "API encoding and decoding of headers is handled transparently by the\n",
    "dictionary-like API of the `~email.message.EmailMessage` class. In\n",
    "addition to uses in legacy code, this module can be useful in\n",
    "applications that need to completely control the character sets used\n",
    "when encoding headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining text in this section is the original documentation of the\n",
    "module.\n",

    "`2822` is the base standard that describes the format of email messages.\n",
    "It derives from the older `822` standard which came into widespread use\n",
    "at a time when most email was composed of ASCII characters only. `2822`\n",
    "is a specification written assuming email contains only 7-bit ASCII\n",
    "characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, as email has been deployed worldwide, it has become\n",
    "internationalized, such that language specific character sets can now be\n",
    "used in email messages. The base standard still requires email messages\n",
    "to be transferred using only 7-bit ASCII characters, so a slew of RFCs\n",
    "have been written describing how to encode email containing non-ASCII\n",
    "characters into `2822`-compliant format. These RFCs include `2045`,\n",
    "`2046`, `2047`, and `2231`. The `email` package supports these standards\n",
    "in its `email.header` and `email.charset` modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to include non-ASCII characters in your email headers, say\n",
    "in the `Subject` or `To` fields, you should use the `Header` class and\n",
    "assign the field in the `~email.message.Message` object to an instance\n",
    "of `Header` instead of using a string for the header value. Import the\n",
    "`Header` class from the `email.header` module. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> from email.message import Message\n",
    "    >>> from email.header import Header\n",
    "    >>> msg = Message()\n",

    "    'Subject: =?iso-8859-1?q?p=F6stal?=\\n\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice here how we wanted the `Subject` field to contain a non-ASCII\n",
    "character? We did this by creating a `Header` instance and passing in\n",
    "the character set that the byte string was encoded in. When the\n",
    "subsequent `~email.message.Message` instance was flattened, the\n",
    "`Subject` field was properly `2047` encoded. MIME-aware mail readers\n",
    "would show this header using the embedded ISO-8859-1 character.\n",
    "\n",

    "Create a MIME-compliant header that can contain strings in different\n",
    "character sets.\n",

    "Optional *s* is the initial header value. If `None` (the default), the\n",
    "initial header value is not set. You can later append to the header with\n",
    "`append` method calls. *s* may be an instance of `bytes` or `str`, but\n",
    "see the `append` documentation for semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional *charset* serves two purposes: it has the same meaning as the\n",
    "*charset* argument to the `append` method. It also sets the default\n",
    "character set for all subsequent `append` calls that omit the *charset*\n",
    "argument. If *charset* is not provided in the constructor (the default),\n",
    "the `us-ascii` character set is used both as *s*'s initial charset and\n",
    "as the default for subsequent `append` calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum line length can be specified explicitly via *maxlinelen*.\n",
    "For splitting the first line to a shorter value (to account for the\n",
    "field header which isn't included in *s*, e.g. `Subject`) pass in the\n",
    "name of the field in *header_name*. The default *maxlinelen* is 76, and\n",
    "the default value for *header_name* is `None`, meaning it is not taken\n",
