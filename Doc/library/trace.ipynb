    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `trace` module allows you to trace program execution, generate\n",
    "annotated statement coverage listings, print caller/callee relationships\n",
    "and list functions executed during a program run. It can be used in\n",
    "another program or from the command line.\n",

    "At least one of the following options must be specified when invoking\n",
