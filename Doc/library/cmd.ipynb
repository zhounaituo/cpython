    "# `cmd` --- Support for line-oriented command interpreters\n",

    "Eric S. Raymond \\<<esr@snark.thyrsus.com>\\>\n",

    "**Source code:** `Lib/cmd.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Cmd` class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented\n",
    "command interpreters. These are often useful for test harnesses,\n",
    "administrative tools, and prototypes that will later be wrapped in a\n",
    "more sophisticated interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Cmd` instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter\n",
    "framework. There is no good reason to instantiate `Cmd` itself; rather,\n",
    "it's useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself\n",
    "in order to inherit `Cmd`'s methods and encapsulate action methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional argument *completekey* is the `readline` name of a\n",
    "completion key; it defaults to `Tab`. If *completekey* is not `None` and\n",
    "`readline` is available, command completion is done automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional arguments *stdin* and *stdout* specify the input and output\n",
    "file objects that the Cmd instance or subclass instance will use for\n",
    "input and output. If not specified, they will default to `sys.stdin` and\n",
    "`sys.stdout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a given *stdin* to be used, make sure to set the instance's\n",
    "`use_rawinput` attribute to `False`, otherwise *stdin* will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cmd Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Cmd` instance has the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cmd.cmdloop(intro=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeatedly issue a prompt, accept input, parse an initial prefix off the\n",
    "received input, and dispatch to action methods, passing them the\n",
    "remainder of the line as argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional argument is a banner or intro string to be issued before\n",
    "the first prompt (this overrides the `intro` class attribute).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `readline` module is loaded, input will automatically inherit\n",
    "`bash`-like history-list editing (e.g. `Control-P` scrolls back to the\n",
    "last command, `Control-N` forward to the next one, `Control-F` moves the\n",
    "cursor to the right non-destructively, `Control-B` moves the cursor to\n",
    "the left non-destructively, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "An end-of-file on input is passed back as the string `'EOF'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: ? (question mark); in a command interpreter single: !\n",
    "(exclamation); in a command interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter instance will recognize a command name `foo` if and only\n",
    "if it has a method `do_foo`. As a special case, a line beginning with\n",
    "the character `'?'` is dispatched to the method `do_help`. As another\n",
    "special case, a line beginning with the character `'!'` is dispatched to\n",
    "the method `do_shell` (if such a method is defined).\n",
    "\n",
    "This method will return when the `postcmd` method returns a true value.\n",
    "The *stop* argument to `postcmd` is the return value from the command's\n",
    "corresponding `do_\\*` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If completion is enabled, completing commands will be done\n",
    "automatically, and completing of commands args is done by calling\n",
    "`complete_foo` with arguments *text*, *line*, *begidx*, and *endidx*.\n",
    "*text* is the string prefix we are attempting to match: all returned\n",
    "matches must begin with it. *line* is the current input line with\n",
    "leading whitespace removed, *begidx* and *endidx* are the beginning and\n",
    "ending indexes of the prefix text, which could be used to provide\n",
    "different completion depending upon which position the argument is in.\n",
    "\n",
    "All subclasses of `Cmd` inherit a predefined `do_help`. This method,\n",
    "called with an argument `'bar'`, invokes the corresponding method\n",
    "`help_bar`, and if that is not present, prints the docstring of\n",
    "`do_bar`, if available. With no argument, `do_help` lists all available\n",
    "help topics (that is, all commands with corresponding `help_\\*` methods\n",
    "or commands that have docstrings), and also lists any undocumented\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response to the\n",
    "prompt. This may be overridden, but should not normally need to be; see\n",
    "the `precmd` and `postcmd` methods for useful execution hooks. The\n",
    "return value is a flag indicating whether interpretation of commands by\n",
    "the interpreter should stop. If there is a `do_\\*` method for the\n",
