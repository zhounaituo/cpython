    "run(coro, \\*, debug=None)\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the `coroutine` *coro* and return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the\n",
    "asyncio event loop, *finalizing asynchronous generators*, and closing\n",

    "This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is\n",

    "If *debug* is `True`, the event loop will be run in debug mode. `False`\n",

    "\n",
    "When `signal.SIGINT` is raised by `Ctrl-C`, `KeyboardInterrupt`\n",

    "hang the program from exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this issue, `asyncio` handles `signal.SIGINT` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `asyncio.Runner.run` installs a custom `signal.SIGINT` handler\n",
    "    before any user code is executed and removes it when exiting from\n",
    "    the function.\n",
    "2.  The `~asyncio.Runner` creates the main task for the passed coroutine\n",
    "    for its execution.\n",
    "3.  When `signal.SIGINT` is raised by `Ctrl-C`, the custom signal\n",
    "    handler cancels the main task by calling `asyncio.Task.cancel` which\n",
    "    raises `asyncio.CancelledError` inside the main task. This causes\n",
    "    the Python stack to unwind, `try/except` and `try/finally` blocks\n",
    "    can be used for resource cleanup. After the main task is cancelled,\n",
    "    `asyncio.Runner.run` raises `KeyboardInterrupt`.\n",
    "4.  A user could write a tight loop which cannot be interrupted by\n",
    "    `asyncio.Task.cancel`, in which case the second following `Ctrl-C`\n",
    "    immediately raises the `KeyboardInterrupt` without cancelling the\n",
    "    main task."
