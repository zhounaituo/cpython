    "In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the\n",
    "presence or absence of prompts (`>>>` and `...`): to repeat the example,\n",
    "you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears;\n",
    "lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter.\n",

    "single: \\# (hash); comment\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait\n",
    "for the primary prompt, `>>>`. (It shouldn't take long.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression\n",
    "at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward:\n",
    "the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` work just like in most other\n",
    "languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (`()`) can be used for\n",
    "grouping. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 2 + 2\n",
    "    4\n",
    "    >>> 50 - 5*6\n",
    "    20\n",
    "    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4\n",
    "    5.0\n",
    "    >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number\n",
    "    1.6\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer numbers (e.g. `2`, `4`, `20`) have type `int`, the ones with\n",
    "a fractional part (e.g. `5.0`, `1.6`) have type `float`. We will see\n",
    "more about numeric types later in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Division (`/`) always returns a float. To do `floor division` and get an\n",
    "integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the `//`\n",
    "operator; to calculate the remainder you can use `%`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float\n",
    "    5.666666666666667\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "    >>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part\n",
    "    5\n",
    "    >>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division\n",
    "    2\n",
    "    >>> 5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder\n",
    "    17\n",
    "\n",
    "With Python, it is possible to use the `**` operator to calculate\n",
    "powers[1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared\n",
    "    25\n",
    "    >>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7\n",
    "    128\n",

    "The equal sign (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable.\n",
    "Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> width = 20\n",
    "    >>> height = 5 * 9\n",
    "    >>> width * height\n",
    "    900\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable is not \"defined\" (assigned a value), trying to use it will\n",
    "give you an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> n  # try to access an undefined variable\n",
    "    Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "      File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "    NameError: name 'n' is not defined\n",

    "There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type\n",
    "operands convert the integer operand to floating point:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 4 * 3.75 - 1\n",
    "    14.0\n",
    "\n",
    "In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the\n",
    "variable `_`. This means that when you are using Python as a desk\n",
    "calculator, it is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> tax = 12.5 / 100\n",
    "    >>> price = 100.50\n",
    "    >>> price * tax\n",

    "    113.0625\n",
    "    >>> round(_, 2)\n",
    "    113.06\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don't\n",
    "explicitly assign a value to it --- you would create an independent\n",
    "local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its\n",
    "magic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `int` and `float`, Python supports other types of\n",
    "numbers, such as `~decimal.Decimal` and `~fractions.Fraction`. Python\n",
    "also has built-in support for `complex numbers <typesnumeric>`, and uses\n",
    "the `j` or `J` suffix to indicate the imaginary part (e.g. `3+5j`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be\n",
    "expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes\n",
    "(`'...'`) or double quotes (`\"...\"`) with the same result[2]. `\\` can be\n",
    "used to escape quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes\n",
    "    'spam eggs'\n",
    "    >>> 'doesn\\'t'  # use \\' to escape the single quote...\n",
    "    \"doesn't\"\n",
    "    >>> \"doesn't\"  # ...or use double quotes instead\n",
    "    \"doesn't\"\n",
    "    >>> '\"Yes,\" they said.'\n",
    "    '\"Yes,\" they said.'\n",
    "    >>> \"\\\"Yes,\\\" they said.\"\n",
    "    '\"Yes,\" they said.'\n",
    "    >>> '\"Isn\\'t,\" they said.'\n",
    "    '\"Isn\\'t,\" they said.'\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes\n",
    "and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this might\n",
    "sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could\n",
    "change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in\n",
    "double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double\n",
    "quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The `print` function\n",
    "produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by\n",
    "printing escaped and special characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> '\"Isn\\'t,\" they said.'\n",
    "    '\"Isn\\'t,\" they said.'\n",
    "    >>> print('\"Isn\\'t,\" they said.')\n",
    "    \"Isn't,\" they said.\n",
    "    >>> s = 'First line.\\nSecond line.'  # \\n means newline\n",
    "    >>> s  # without print(), \\n is included in the output\n",
    "    'First line.\\nSecond line.'\n",
    "    >>> print(s)  # with print(), \\n produces a new line\n",
    "    First line.\n",
    "    Second line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want characters prefaced by `\\` to be interpreted as\n",
    "special characters, you can use *raw strings* by adding an `r` before\n",
    "the first quote:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print('C:\\some\\name')  # here \\n means newline!\n",
    "    C:\\some\n",
    "    ame\n",
    "    >>> print(r'C:\\some\\name')  # note the r before the quote\n",
    "    C:\\some\\name\n",
    "\n",
    "String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes:\n",
    "`\"\"\"...\"\"\"` or `'''...'''`. End of lines are automatically included in\n",
    "the string, but it's possible to prevent this by adding a `\\` at the end\n",
    "of the line. The following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"\"\"\\\n",
    "    Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]\n",
    "         -h                        Display this usage message\n",
    "         -H hostname               Hostname to connect to\n",
    "    \"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "produces the following output (note that the initial newline is not\n",
    "included):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]\n",
    "     -h                        Display this usage message\n",
    "     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the `+` operator, and\n",
    "repeated with `*`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'\n",
    "    >>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'\n",
    "    'unununium'\n",
    "\n",
    "Two or more *string literals* (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes)\n",
    "next to each other are automatically concatenated. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 'Py' 'thon'\n",
    "    'Python'\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings:\n",
    "\n",

    "    ...         'to have them joined together.')\n",
    "    >>> text\n",
    "    'Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.'\n",

    "Strings can be *indexed* (subscripted), with the first character having\n",

    "    >>> word = 'Python'\n",

    "Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> word[-1]  # last character\n",
    "    'n'\n",

    "Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to indexing, *slicing* is also supported. While indexing is\n",
