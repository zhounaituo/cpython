    "\n",
    "## Fancier Output Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've encountered two ways of writing values: *expression\n",
    "statements* and the `print` function. (A third way is using the `write`\n",
    "method of file objects; the standard output file can be referenced as\n",
    "`sys.stdout`. See the Library Reference for more information on this.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you'll want more control over the formatting of your output than\n",
    "simply printing space-separated values. There are several ways to format\n",
    "output.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To use `formatted string literals <tut-f-strings>`, begin a string\n",
    "    with `f` or `F` before the opening quotation mark or triple\n",
    "    quotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python\n",
    "    expression between `{` and `}` characters that can refer to\n",
    "    variables or literal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> year = 2016\n",
    "        >>> event = 'Referendum'\n",
    "        >>> f'Results of the {year} {event}'\n",
    "        'Results of the 2016 Referendum'\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `str.format` method of strings requires more manual effort.\n",
    "    You'll still use `{` and `}` to mark where a variable will be\n",
    "    substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but\n",
    "    you'll also need to provide the information to be formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> yes_votes = 42_572_654\n",
    "        >>> no_votes = 43_132_495\n",

    "-   Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string\n",
    "    slicing and concatenation operations to create any layout you can\n",

    "    operations for padding strings to a given column width.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you don't need fancy output but just want a quick display of some\n",

    "with the `repr` or `str` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str` function is meant to return representations of values which\n",
    "are fairly human-readable, while `repr` is meant to generate\n",
    "representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a\n",
    "`SyntaxError` if there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which don't\n",
    "have a particular representation for human consumption, `str` will\n",
    "return the same value as `repr`. Many values, such as numbers or\n",
    "structures like lists and dictionaries, have the same representation\n",
    "using either function. Strings, in particular, have two distinct\n",
    "representations.\n",

    "by prefixing the string with `f` or `F` and writing expressions as\n",
    "`{expression}`.\n",
    "\n",

    "    The value of pi is approximately 3.142.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing an integer after the `':'` will cause that field to be a minimum\n",
    "number of characters wide. This is useful for making columns line up. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 7678}\n",
    "    >>> for name, phone in table.items():\n",

    "\n",
    "Other modifiers can be used to convert the value before it is formatted.\n",
    "`'!a'` applies `ascii`, `'!s'` applies `str`, and `'!r'` applies `repr`:\n",

    "### The String format() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic usage of the `str.format` method looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print('We are the {} who say \"{}!\"'.format('knights', 'Ni'))\n",
    "    We are the knights who say \"Ni!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The brackets and characters within them (called format fields) are\n",
    "replaced with the objects passed into the `str.format` method. A number\n",
    "in the brackets can be used to refer to the position of the object\n",
    "passed into the `str.format` method. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print('{0} and {1}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))\n",
    "    spam and eggs\n",
    "    >>> print('{1} and {0}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))\n",
    "    eggs and spam\n",
    "\n",
    "If keyword arguments are used in the `str.format` method, their values\n",
    "are referred to by using the name of the argument. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print('This {food} is {adjective}.'.format(\n",
    "    ...       food='spam', adjective='absolutely horrible'))\n",
    "    This spam is absolutely horrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print('The story of {0}, {1}, and {other}.'.format('Bill', 'Manfred',\n",
    "                                                           other='Georg'))\n",
    "    The story of Bill, Manfred, and Georg.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a really long format string that you don't want to split up,\n",
    "it would be nice if you could reference the variables to be formatted by\n",
    "name instead of by position. This can be done by simply passing the dict\n",
    "and using square brackets `'[]'` to access the keys. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}\n",
    "    >>> print('Jack: {0[Jack]:d}; Sjoerd: {0[Sjoerd]:d}; '\n",

    "    Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678\n",
    "\n",
    "This could also be done by passing the table as keyword arguments with\n",
    "the '\\*\\*' notation. :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}\n",

    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful in combination with the built-in function\n",
    "`vars`, which returns a dictionary containing all local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the following lines produce a tidily-aligned set of\n",
    "columns giving integers and their squares and cubes:\n",

    "    10 100 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that the one space between each column was added by the way\n",
    "`print` works: it always adds spaces between its arguments.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `str.rjust` method of string objects right-justifies a string in a\n",
    "field of a given width by padding it with spaces on the left. There are\n",
    "similar methods `str.ljust` and `str.center`. These methods do not write\n",
    "anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too\n",
    "long, they don't truncate it, but return it unchanged; this will mess up\n",
    "your column lay-out but that's usually better than the alternative,\n",
    "which would be lying about a value. (If you really want truncation you\n",
    "can always add a slice operation, as in `x.ljust(n)[:n]`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another method, `str.zfill`, which pads a numeric string on the\n",
    "left with zeros. It understands about plus and minus signs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> '12'.zfill(5)\n",

    "\n",
    "The % operator (modulo) can also be used for string formatting. Given\n",
    "`'string' % values`, instances of `%` in `string` are replaced with zero\n",
    "or more elements of `values`. This operation is commonly known as string\n",
    "interpolation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import math\n",
    "    >>> print('The value of pi is approximately %5.3f.' % math.pi)\n",
    "    The value of pi is approximately 3.142.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information can be found in the `old-string-formatting` section.\n",

    "## Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "builtin: open object: file\n",
    "\n",
    "`open` returns a `file object`, and is most commonly used with two\n",
    "positional arguments and one keyword argument:\n",
    "`open(filename, mode, encoding=None)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> f = open('workfile', 'w', encoding=\"utf-8\")\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\>\\>\\> print(f) \\<open file 'workfile', mode 'w' at 80a0960\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second\n",
    "argument is another string containing a few characters describing the\n",
    "way in which the file will be used. *mode* can be `'r'` when the file\n",
    "will only be read, `'w'` for only writing (an existing file with the\n",
    "same name will be erased), and `'a'` opens the file for appending; any\n",
    "data written to the file is automatically added to the end. `'r+'` opens\n",
    "the file for both reading and writing. The *mode* argument is optional;\n",
    "`'r'` will be assumed if it's omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, files are opened in `text mode`, that means, you read and\n",
    "write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific\n",
    "*encoding*. If *encoding* is not specified, the default is platform\n",
    "dependent (see `open`). Because UTF-8 is the modern de-facto standard,\n",
    "`encoding=\"utf-8\"` is recommended unless you know that you need to use a\n",
    "different encoding. Appending a `'b'` to the mode opens the file in\n",
    "`binary mode`. Binary mode data is read and written as `bytes` objects.\n",
    "You can not specify *encoding* when opening file in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific\n",
    "line endings (`\\n` on Unix, `\\r\\n` on Windows) to just `\\n`. When\n",
    "writing in text mode, the default is to convert occurrences of `\\n` back\n",
    "to platform-specific line endings. This behind-the-scenes modification\n",
    "to file data is fine for text files, but will corrupt binary data like\n",
    "that in `JPEG` or `EXE` files. Be very careful to use binary mode when\n",
    "reading and writing such files.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to use the `with` keyword when dealing with file\n",
    "objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its\n",
    "suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using\n",
