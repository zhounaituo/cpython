    "Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering\n",
    "much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or\n",
    "batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more\n",
    "error checking than C, and, being a *very-high-level language*, it has\n",
    "high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and\n",
    "dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is\n",
    "applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet\n",
    "many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused\n",
    "in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard\n",
    "modules that you can use as the basis of your programs --- or as\n",
    "examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules\n",
    "provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces\n",
    "to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time\n",
    "during program development because no compilation and linking is\n",
    "necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it\n",
    "easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away\n",
    "programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It\n",

    "\n",
    "-   the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in\n",

    "-   no variable or argument declarations are necessary.\n",

    "Python is *extensible*: if you know how to program in C it is easy to\n",
    "add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to\n",
    "perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs\n",
    "to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a\n",
    "vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can\n",
    "link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it\n",
    "as an extension or command language for that application.\n",

    "By the way, the language is named after the BBC show \"Monty Python's\n",
