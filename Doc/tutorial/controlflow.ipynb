    "# More Control Flow Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the `while` statement just introduced, Python uses the usual\n",
    "flow control statements known from other languages, with some twists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `!if` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the `if` statement. For\n",
    "example:\n",

    "There can be zero or more `elif` parts, and the `else` part is optional.\n",
    "The keyword '`!elif`' is short for 'else if', and is useful to avoid\n",
    "excessive indentation. An `!if` ... `!elif` ... `!elif` ... sequence is\n",
    "a substitute for the `switch` or `case` statements found in other\n",
    "languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're comparing the same value to several constants, or checking for\n",
    "specific types or attributes, you may also find the `!match` statement\n",
    "useful. For more details see `tut-match`.\n",

    "## `!for` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "statement: for\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to\n",
    "in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic\n",
    "progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability\n",
    "to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python's\n",
    "`!for` statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a\n",
    "string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no\n",
    "pun intended):\n",

    "    defenestrate 12\n",
    "\n",
    "Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same\n",
    "collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more\n",
    "straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a\n",

    "## The `range` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in\n",
    "function `range` comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> for i in range(5):\n",
    "    ...     print(i)\n",
    "    ...\n",

    "    3\n",
    "    4\n",
    "\n",
    "The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; `range(10)`\n",
    "generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length\n",
    "10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to\n",
    "specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called\n",
    "the 'step'):\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> list(range(5, 10))\n",
    "    [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> list(range(0, 10, 3))\n",
    "    [0, 3, 6, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> list(range(-10, -100, -30))\n",
    "    [-10, -40, -70]\n",
    "\n",
    "To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine `range` and\n",
    "`len` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']\n",
    "    >>> for i in range(len(a)):\n",
    "    ...     print(i, a[i])\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    0 Mary\n",
    "    1 had\n",
    "    2 a\n",
    "    3 little\n",
    "    4 lamb\n",
    "\n",
    "In most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the `enumerate`\n",
    "function, see `tut-loopidioms`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strange thing happens if you just print a range:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> range(10)\n",
    "    range(0, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways the object returned by `range` behaves as if it is a list,\n",
    "but in fact it isn't. It is an object which returns the successive items\n",
    "of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn't really\n",
    "make the list, thus saving space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say such an object is `iterable`, that is, suitable as a target for\n",
    "functions and constructs that expect something from which they can\n",
    "obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen that\n",
    "the `for` statement is such a construct, while an example of a function\n",
    "that takes an iterable is `sum`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> sum(range(4))  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3\n",
    "    6\n",
    "\n",
    "Later we will see more functions that return iterables and take\n",
    "iterables as arguments. In chapter `tut-structures`, we will discuss in\n",
    "more detail about `list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `!break` and `!continue` Statements, and `!else` Clauses on Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The `break` statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing\n",
    "`for` or `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop statements may have an `!else` clause; it is executed when the loop\n",
    "terminates through exhaustion of the iterable (with `for`) or when the\n",
    "condition becomes false (with `while`), but not when the loop is\n",
    "terminated by a `break` statement. This is exemplified by the following\n",
    "loop, which searches for prime numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> for n in range(2, 10):\n",
    "    ...     for x in range(2, n):\n",
    "    ...         if n % x == 0:\n",
    "    ...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)\n",
    "    ...             break\n",
    "    ...     else:\n",
    "    ...         # loop fell through without finding a factor\n",
    "    ...         print(n, 'is a prime number')\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    2 is a prime number\n",
    "    3 is a prime number\n",
    "    4 equals 2 * 2\n",
    "    5 is a prime number\n",
    "    6 equals 2 * 3\n",
    "    7 is a prime number\n",
    "    8 equals 2 * 4\n",
    "    9 equals 3 * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "(Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the `else` clause belongs\n",
    "to the `for` loop, **not** the `if` statement.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When used with a loop, the `else` clause has more in common with the\n",
    "`else` clause of a `try` statement than it does with that of `if`\n",
    "statements: a `try` statement's `else` clause runs when no exception\n",
    "occurs, and a loop's `else` clause runs when no `break` occurs. For more\n",
    "on the `!try` statement and exceptions, see `tut-handling`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `continue` statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next\n",
    "iteration of the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> for num in range(2, 10):\n",
    "    ...     if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    ...         print(\"Found an even number\", num)\n",

    "    Found an odd number 7\n",
    "    Found an even number 8\n",
    "    Found an odd number 9\n",
    "\n",
    "## `!pass` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pass` statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is\n",
    "required syntactically but the program requires no action. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> while True:\n",
    "    ...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> class MyEmptyClass:\n",
    "    ...     pass\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Another place `pass` can be used is as a place-holder for a function or\n",
    "conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep\n",
    "thinking at a more abstract level. The `!pass` is silently ignored:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> def initlog(*args):\n",
    "    ...     pass   # Remember to implement this!\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## `!match` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A `match` statement takes an expression and compares its value to\n",
    "successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. This is\n",
    "superficially similar to a switch statement in C, Java or JavaScript\n",
    "(and many other languages), but it can also extract components (sequence\n",
    "elements or object attributes) from the value into variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form compares a subject value against one or more literals:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def http_error(status):\n",
    "        match status:\n",
    "            case 400:\n",
    "                return \"Bad request\"\n",
    "            case 404:\n",
    "                return \"Not found\"\n",
    "            case 418:\n",

    "            case _:\n",
    "                return \"Something's wrong with the internet\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the last block: the \"variable name\" `_` acts as a *wildcard* and\n",
    "never fails to match. If no case matches, none of the branches is\n",
    "executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine several literals in a single pattern using `|` (\"or\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "    case 401 | 403 | 404:\n",
    "        return \"Not allowed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns can look like unpacking assignments, and can be used to bind\n",
    "variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # point is an (x, y) tuple\n",
    "    match point:\n",
    "        case (0, 0):\n",

    "\n",
    "Study that one carefully! The first pattern has two literals, and can be\n",
    "thought of as an extension of the literal pattern shown above. But the\n",
    "next two patterns combine a literal and a variable, and the variable\n",
    "*binds* a value from the subject (`point`). The fourth pattern captures\n",
    "two values, which makes it conceptually similar to the unpacking\n",
    "assignment `(x, y) = point`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using classes to structure your data you can use the class\n",
    "name followed by an argument list resembling a constructor, but with the\n",
    "ability to capture attributes into variables:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can use positional parameters with some builtin classes that provide\n",
    "an ordering for their attributes (e.g. dataclasses). You can also define\n",
    "a specific position for attributes in patterns by setting the\n",
    "`__match_args__` special attribute in your classes. If it's set to (\"x\",\n",
    "\"y\"), the following patterns are all equivalent (and all bind the `y`\n",

    "    Point(x=1, y=var)\n",
    "    Point(y=var, x=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommended way to read patterns is to look at them as an extended\n",
    "form of what you would put on the left of an assignment, to understand\n",
    "which variables would be set to what. Only the standalone names (like\n",
    "`var` above) are assigned to by a match statement. Dotted names (like\n",

    "(recognized by the \"(...)\" next to them like `Point` above) are never\n",
    "assigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns can be arbitrarily nested. For example, if we have a short list\n",

    "        case _:\n",
    "            print(\"Something else\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add an `if` clause to a pattern, known as a \"guard\". If the guard\n",

    "    least two items without binding the remaining items.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Mapping patterns: `{\"bandwidth\": b, \"latency\": l}` captures the\n",
    "    `\"bandwidth\"` and `\"latency\"` values from a dictionary. Unlike\n",
    "    sequence patterns, extra keys are ignored. An unpacking like\n",
    "    `**rest` is also supported. (But `**_` would be redundant, so it is\n",

    "The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more\n",
    "arguments. This creates a function that can be called with fewer\n",
    "arguments than it is defined to allow. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):\n",
    "        while True:\n",
    "            ok = input(prompt)\n",

    "                raise ValueError('invalid user response')\n",
    "            print(reminder)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function can be called in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   giving only the mandatory argument:\n",
    "    `ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')`\n",
    "-   giving one of the optional arguments:\n",
    "    `ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)`\n",
    "-   or even giving all arguments:\n",
    "    `ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')`\n",
    "\n",
    "This example also introduces the `in` keyword. This tests whether or not\n",
    "a sequence contains a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in\n",

    "**Important warning:** The default value is evaluated only once. This\n",
    "makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list,\n",
    "dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the following\n",
    "function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:\n",

    "    print(f(2))\n",
    "    print(f(3))\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print :\n",
    "\n",
    "    [1]\n",
    "    [1, 2]\n",
    "    [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you\n",
    "can write the function like this instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def f(a, L=None):\n",
    "        if L is None:\n",
    "            L = []\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to\n",
    "    use `UpperCamelCase` for classes and `lowercase_with_underscores`\n",
    "    for functions and methods. Always use `self` as the name for the\n",
    "    first method argument (see `tut-firstclasses` for more on classes\n",
    "    and methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Don't use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in\n",
