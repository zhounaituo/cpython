    "# Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the\n",
    "definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore,\n",
    "if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using\n",
    "a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it\n",
    "with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a *script*.\n",
    "As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files\n",
    "for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that\n",
    "you've written in several programs without copying its definition into\n",
    "each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use\n",
    "them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such\n",
    "a file is called a *module*; definitions from a module can be *imported*\n",
    "into other modules or into the *main* module (the collection of\n",
    "variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level\n",
    "and in calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The\n",
    "file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. Within a\n",
    "module, the module's name (as a string) is available as the value of the\n",
    "global variable `__name__`. For instance, use your favorite text editor\n",
    "to create a file called `fibo.py` in the current directory with the\n",
    "following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Fibonacci numbers module\n",
    "\n",
    "    def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n\n",
    "        a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "        while a < n:\n",
    "            print(a, end=' ')\n",
    "            a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "        print()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def fib2(n):   # return Fibonacci series up to n\n",
    "        result = []\n",
    "        a, b = 0, 1\n",
    "        while a < n:\n",
    "            result.append(a)\n",
    "            a, b = b, a+b\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "\n",
    "Now enter the Python interpreter and import this module with the\n",
    "following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import fibo\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not enter the names of the functions defined in `fibo`\n",
    "directly in the current symbol table; it only enters the module name\n",
    "`fibo` there. Using the module name you can access the functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> fibo.fib(1000)\n",
    "    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987\n",
    "    >>> fibo.fib2(100)\n",
    "    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]\n",
    "    >>> fibo.__name__\n",
    "    'fibo'\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to use a function often you can assign it to a local name:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> fib = fibo.fib\n",
    "    >>> fib(500)\n",
    "    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\n",
    "\n",
    "## More on Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A module can contain executable statements as well as function\n",
    "definitions. These statements are intended to initialize the module.\n",
    "They are executed only the *first* time the module name is encountered\n",
    "in an import statement.[1] (They are also run if the file is executed as\n",
    "a script.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the\n",
    "global symbol table by all functions defined in the module. Thus, the\n",
    "author of a module can use global variables in the module without\n",
    "worrying about accidental clashes with a user's global variables. On the\n",
    "other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a module's\n",
    "global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions,\n",
    "`modname.itemname`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can import other modules. It is customary but not required to\n",
    "place all `import` statements at the beginning of a module (or script,\n",
    "for that matter). The imported module names are placed in the importing\n",
    "module's global symbol table.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a variant of the `import` statement that imports names from a\n",
    "module directly into the importing module's symbol table. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> from fibo import fib, fib2\n",
    "    >>> fib(500)\n",
    "    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not introduce the module name from which the imports are taken\n",
    "in the local symbol table (so in the example, `fibo` is not defined).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is even a variant to import all names that a module defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> from fibo import *\n",
    "    >>> fib(500)\n",
    "    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\n",
    "\n",
    "This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (`_`).\n",
    "In most cases Python programmers do not use this facility since it\n",
    "introduces an unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly hiding\n",
    "some things you have already defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in general the practice of importing `*` from a module or\n",
    "package is frowned upon, since it often causes poorly readable code.\n",
    "However, it is okay to use it to save typing in interactive sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the module name is followed by `!as`, then the name following `!as`\n",
    "is bound directly to the imported module.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import fibo as fib\n",
    "    >>> fib.fib(500)\n",
    "    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\n",
    "\n",
    "This is effectively importing the module in the same way that\n",
    "`import fibo` will do, with the only difference of it being available as\n",
    "`fib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be used when utilising `from` with similar effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> from fibo import fib as fibonacci\n",
    "    >>> fibonacci(500)\n",
    "    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "For efficiency reasons, each module is only imported once per\n",
    "interpreter session. Therefore, if you change your modules, you must\n",
    "restart the interpreter -- or, if it's just one module you want to test\n",
    "interactively, use `importlib.reload`, e.g.\n",
    "`import importlib; importlib.reload(modulename)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing modules as scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Python module with :\n",
    "\n",
    "    python fibo.py <arguments>\n",
    "\n",
    "the code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but\n",
    "with the `__name__` set to `\"__main__\"`. That means that by adding this\n",
    "code at the end of your module:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "        import sys\n",
    "        fib(int(sys.argv[1]))\n",
    "\n",
    "you can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable\n",
    "module, because the code that parses the command line only runs if the\n",
    "module is executed as the \"main\" file:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell-session\n",
    "$ python fibo.py 50\n",
    "0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the module is imported, the code is not run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import fibo\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often used either to provide a convenient user interface to a\n",
    "module, or for testing purposes (running the module as a script executes\n",
    "a test suite).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Module Search Path\n",
    "\n",
    "triple: module; search; path\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module named `spam` is imported, the interpreter first searches\n",
    "for a built-in module with that name. These module names are listed in\n",
    "`sys.builtin_module_names`. If not found, it then searches for a file\n",
    "named `spam.py` in a list of directories given by the variable\n",
    "`sys.path`. `sys.path` is initialized from these locations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The directory containing the input script (or the current directory\n",
    "    when no file is specified).\n",
    "-   `PYTHONPATH` (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the\n",
    "    shell variable `PATH`).\n",
    "-   The installation-dependent default (by convention including a\n",
    "    `site-packages` directory, handled by the `site` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "More details are at `sys-path-init`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "On file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the\n",
    "input script is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words\n",
    "the directory containing the symlink is **not** added to the module\n",
    "search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initialization, Python programs can modify `sys.path`. The\n",
    "directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of\n",
    "the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that\n",
    "scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same\n",
    "name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement\n",
    "is intended. See section `tut-standardmodules` for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Compiled\" Python files\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each\n",
    "module in the `__pycache__` directory under the name\n",
    "`module.{version}.pyc`, where the version encodes the format of the\n",
    "compiled file; it generally contains the Python version number. For\n",
    "example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiled version of spam.py would be\n",
    "cached as `__pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc`. This naming convention\n",
    "allows compiled modules from different releases and different versions\n",
    "of Python to coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python checks the modification date of the source against the compiled\n",
    "version to see if it's out of date and needs to be recompiled. This is a\n",
    "completely automatic process. Also, the compiled modules are\n",
    "platform-independent, so the same library can be shared among systems\n",
    "with different architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not check the cache in two circumstances. First, it always\n",
    "recompiles and does not store the result for the module that's loaded\n",
    "directly from the command line. Second, it does not check the cache if\n",
    "there is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only)\n",
    "distribution, the compiled module must be in the source directory, and\n",
    "there must not be a source module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips for experts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can use the `-O` or `-OO` switches on the Python command to\n",
    "    reduce the size of a compiled module. The `-O` switch removes assert\n",
    "    statements, the `-OO` switch removes both assert statements and\n",
    "    \\_\\_doc\\_\\_ strings. Since some programs may rely on having these\n",
    "    available, you should only use this option if you know what you're\n",
    "    doing. \"Optimized\" modules have an `opt-` tag and are usually\n",
    "    smaller. Future releases may change the effects of optimization.\n",
    "-   A program doesn't run any faster when it is read from a `.pyc` file\n",
    "    than when it is read from a `.py` file; the only thing that's faster\n",
    "    about `.pyc` files is the speed with which they are loaded.\n",
    "-   The module `compileall` can create .pyc files for all modules in a\n",
    "    directory.\n",
    "-   There is more detail on this process, including a flow chart of the\n",
    "    decisions, in `3147`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "module: sys\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a library of standard modules, described in a separate\n",
    "document, the Python Library Reference (\"Library Reference\" hereafter).\n",
    "Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access to\n",
    "operations that are not part of the core of the language but are\n",
    "nevertheless built in, either for efficiency or to provide access to\n",
    "operating system primitives such as system calls. The set of such\n",
    "modules is a configuration option which also depends on the underlying\n",
    "platform. For example, the `winreg` module is only provided on Windows\n",
    "systems. One particular module deserves some attention: `sys`, which is\n",
    "built into every Python interpreter. The variables `sys.ps1` and\n",
    "`sys.ps2` define the strings used as primary and secondary prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import sys\n",
    "    >>> sys.ps1\n",
    "    '>>> '\n",
    "    >>> sys.ps2\n",
    "    '... '\n",
    "    >>> sys.ps1 = 'C> '\n",
    "    C> print('Yuck!')\n",
    "    Yuck!\n",
    "    C>\n",
    "\n",
    "These two variables are only defined if the interpreter is in\n",
    "interactive mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `sys.path` is a list of strings that determines the\n",
    "interpreter's search path for modules. It is initialized to a default\n",
    "path taken from the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`, or from a\n",
    "built-in default if `PYTHONPATH` is not set. You can modify it using\n",
    "standard list operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import sys\n",
    "    >>> sys.path.append('/ufs/guido/lib/python')\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `dir` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `dir` is used to find out which names a module\n",
    "defines. It returns a sorted list of strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import fibo, sys\n",
    "    >>> dir(fibo)\n",

    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are a way of structuring Python's module namespace by using\n",
    "\"dotted module names\". For example, the module name `A.B` designates a\n",
    "submodule named `B` in a package named `A`. Just like the use of modules\n",
    "saves the authors of different modules from having to worry about each\n",
    "other's global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the\n",
    "authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or Pillow from having to\n",
    "worry about each other's module names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to design a collection of modules (a \"package\") for the\n",
    "uniform handling of sound files and sound data. There are many different\n",
    "sound file formats (usually recognized by their extension, for example:\n",
    "`.wav`, `.aiff`, `.au`), so you may need to create and maintain a\n",
    "growing collection of modules for the conversion between the various\n",
    "file formats. There are also many different operations you might want to\n",
    "perform on sound data (such as mixing, adding echo, applying an\n",
    "equalizer function, creating an artificial stereo effect), so in\n",
    "addition you will be writing a never-ending stream of modules to perform\n",
    "these operations. Here's a possible structure for your package\n",
    "(expressed in terms of a hierarchical filesystem):\n",

    "\n",
    "    __all__ = [\"echo\", \"surround\", \"reverse\"]\n",

    "    from ..filters import equalizer\n",
    "\n",
