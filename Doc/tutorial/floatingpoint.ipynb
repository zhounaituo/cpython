    "Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2\n",
    "(binary) fractions. For example, the **decimal** fraction `0.125` has\n",
    "value 1/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000, and in the same way the **binary** fraction\n",
    "`0.001` has value 0/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have identical\n",
    "values, the only real difference being that the first is written in base\n",
    "10 fractional notation, and the second in base 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as\n",
    "binary fractions. A consequence is that, in general, the decimal\n",
    "floating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary\n",
    "floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is easier to understand at first in base 10. Consider the\n",
    "fraction 1/3. You can approximate that as a base 10 fraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.3\n",
    "\n",
    "or, better, :\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.33\n",
    "\n",
    "or, better, :\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.333\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. No matter how many digits you're willing to write down, the\n",
    "result will never be exactly 1/3, but will be an increasingly better\n",
    "approximation of 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, no matter how many base 2 digits you're willing to use,\n",
    "the decimal value 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a base 2\n",
    "fraction. In base 2, 1/10 is the infinitely repeating fraction :\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011...\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop at any finite number of bits, and you get an approximation. On most\n",
    "machines today, floats are approximated using a binary fraction with the\n",
    "numerator using the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit\n",
    "and with the denominator as a power of two. In the case of 1/10, the\n",
    "binary fraction is `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55` which is close to but\n",
    "not exactly equal to the true value of 1/10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many users are not aware of the approximation because of the way values\n",
    "are displayed. Python only prints a decimal approximation to the true\n",
    "decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine. On most\n",
    "machines, if Python were to print the true decimal value of the binary\n",
    "approximation stored for 0.1, it would have to display :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 0.1\n",
    "    0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625\n",
    "\n",
    "That is more digits than most people find useful, so Python keeps the\n",
    "number of digits manageable by displaying a rounded value instead :\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 1 / 10\n",
    "    0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Just remember, even though the printed result looks like the exact value\n",
    "of 1/10, the actual stored value is the nearest representable binary\n",
    "fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there are many different decimal numbers that share the\n",
    "same nearest approximate binary fraction. For example, the numbers `0.1`\n",
    "and `0.10000000000000001` and\n",
    "`0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625` are all\n",
    "approximated by `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55`. Since all of these decimal\n",
    "values share the same approximation, any one of them could be displayed\n",
    "while still preserving the invariant `eval(repr(x)) == x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the Python prompt and built-in `repr` function would\n",
    "choose the one with 17 significant digits, `0.10000000000000001`.\n",
    "Starting with Python 3.1, Python (on most systems) is now able to choose\n",
    "the shortest of these and simply display `0.1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is in the very nature of binary floating-point: this is\n",
    "not a bug in Python, and it is not a bug in your code either. You'll see\n",
    "the same kind of thing in all languages that support your hardware's\n",
    "floating-point arithmetic (although some languages may not *display* the\n",
    "difference by default, or in all output modes).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more pleasant output, you may wish to use string formatting to\n",
    "produce a limited number of significant digits:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> format(math.pi, '.12g')  # give 12 significant digits\n",
    "    '3.14159265359'\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> format(math.pi, '.2f')   # give 2 digits after the point\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to realize that this is, in a real sense, an illusion:\n",
    "you're simply rounding the *display* of the true machine value.\n",
    "\n",
    "One illusion may beget another. For example, since 0.1 is not exactly\n",
    "1/10, summing three values of 0.1 may not yield exactly 0.3, either:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> .1 + .1 + .1 == .3\n",
    "    False\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, since the 0.1 cannot get any closer to the exact value of 1/10 and\n",
    "0.3 cannot get any closer to the exact value of 3/10, then pre-rounding\n",
    "with `round` function cannot help:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> round(.1, 1) + round(.1, 1) + round(.1, 1) == round(.3, 1)\n",
    "    False\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the numbers cannot be made closer to their intended exact values,\n",
    "the `round` function can be useful for post-rounding so that results\n",
    "with inexact values become comparable to one another:\n",
