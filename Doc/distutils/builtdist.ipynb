    "# Creating Built Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is being retained solely until the `setuptools`\n",
    "documentation at\n",
    "<https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html>\n",
    "independently covers all of the relevant information currently included\n",
    "here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"built distribution\" is what you're probably used to thinking of\n",
    "either as a \"binary package\" or an \"installer\" (depending on your\n",
    "background). It's not necessarily binary, though, because it might\n",
    "contain only Python source code and/or byte-code; and we don't call it a\n",
    "package, because that word is already spoken for in Python. (And\n",
    "\"installer\" is a term specific to the world of mainstream desktop\n",
    "systems.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A built distribution is how you make life as easy as possible for\n",
    "installers of your module distribution: for users of RPM-based Linux\n",
    "systems, it's a binary RPM; for Windows users, it's an executable\n",
    "installer; for Debian-based Linux users, it's a Debian package; and so\n",
    "forth. Obviously, no one person will be able to create built\n",
    "distributions for every platform under the sun, so the Distutils are\n",
    "designed to enable module developers to concentrate on their\n",
    "specialty---writing code and creating source distributions---while an\n",
    "intermediary species called *packagers* springs up to turn source\n",
    "distributions into built distributions for as many platforms as there\n",
    "are packagers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the module developer could be their own packager; or the\n",
    "packager could be a volunteer \"out there\" somewhere who has access to a\n",
    "platform which the original developer does not; or it could be software\n",
    "periodically grabbing new source distributions and turning them into\n",
    "built distributions for as many platforms as the software has access to.\n",
    "Regardless of who they are, a packager uses the setup script and the\n",
    "`bdist` command family to generate built distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple example, if I run the following command in the Distutils\n",
    "source tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python setup.py bdist\n",
    "\n",
    "then the Distutils builds my module distribution (the Distutils itself\n",
    "in this case), does a \"fake\" installation (also in the `build`\n",
    "directory), and creates the default type of built distribution for my\n",
    "platform. The default format for built distributions is a \"dumb\" tar\n",
    "file on Unix, and a simple executable installer on Windows. (That tar\n",
    "file is considered \"dumb\" because it has to be unpacked in a specific\n",
    "location to work.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the above command on a Unix system creates\n",
    "`Distutils-1.0.{plat}.tar.gz`; unpacking this tarball from the right\n",
    "place installs the Distutils just as though you had downloaded the\n",
    "source distribution and run `python setup.py install`. (The \"right\n",
    "place\" is either the root of the filesystem or Python's `{prefix}`\n",
    "directory, depending on the options given to the `bdist_dumb` command;\n",
    "the default is to make dumb distributions relative to `{prefix}`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, for pure Python distributions, this isn't any simpler than\n",
    "just running `python setup.py install`---but for non-pure distributions,\n",
    "which include extensions that would need to be compiled, it can mean the\n",
    "difference between someone being able to use your extensions or not. And\n",
    "creating \"smart\" built distributions, such as an RPM package or an\n",
    "executable installer for Windows, is far more convenient for users even\n",
    "if your distribution doesn't include any extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bdist` command has a `!--formats` option, similar to the `sdist`\n",
    "command, which you can use to select the types of built distribution to\n",
    "generate: for example, :\n",
    "\n",
    "    python setup.py bdist --format=zip\n",
    "\n",
    "would, when run on a Unix system, create\n",
    "`Distutils-1.0.{plat}.zip`---again, this archive would be unpacked from\n",
    "the root directory to install the Distutils.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available formats for built distributions are:\n",

    "\n",
    "The RPM format is used by many popular Linux distributions, including\n",
    "Red Hat, SuSE, and Mandrake. If one of these (or any of the other\n",
    "RPM-based Linux distributions) is your usual environment, creating RPM\n",
    "packages for other users of that same distribution is trivial. Depending\n",
    "on the complexity of your module distribution and differences between\n",

    "different RPM-based distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual way to create an RPM of your module distribution is to run the\n",
    "`bdist_rpm` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python setup.py bdist_rpm\n",
    "\n",
    "or the `bdist` command with the `!--format` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python setup.py bdist --formats=rpm\n",
    "\n",
    "The former allows you to specify RPM-specific options; the latter allows\n",
    "you to easily specify multiple formats in one run. If you need to do\n",
    "both, you can explicitly specify multiple `bdist_\\*` commands and their\n",
    "options:\n",
    "\n",

    "Obviously, supplying even a few of these options on the command-line\n",

    "If you distribute or package many Python module distributions, you might\n",

    "configuration file (`~/.pydistutils.cfg`). If you want to temporarily\n",
    "disable this file, you can pass the `!--no-user-cfg` option to\n",
    "`setup.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps to building a binary RPM package, all of which are\n",
    "handled automatically by the Distutils:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  create a `.spec` file, which describes the package (analogous to the\n",
    "    Distutils setup script; in fact, much of the information in the\n",
    "    setup script winds up in the `.spec` file)\n",
    "2.  create the source RPM\n",
    "3.  create the \"binary\" RPM (which may or may not contain binary code,\n",
    "    depending on whether your module distribution contains Python\n",
    "    extensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, RPM bundles the last two steps together; when you use the\n",
    "Distutils, all three steps are typically bundled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish, you can separate these three steps. You can use the\n",
    "`!--spec-only` option to make `bdist_rpm` just create the `.spec` file\n",
    "and exit; in this case, the `.spec` file will be written to the\n",
    "\"distribution directory\"---normally `dist/`, but customizable with the\n",
    "`!--dist-dir` option. (Normally, the `.spec` file winds up deep in the\n",
    "\"build tree,\" in a temporary directory created by `bdist_rpm`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross-compiling on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with Python 2.6, distutils is capable of cross-compiling\n",
    "between Windows platforms. In practice, this means that with the correct\n",
    "tools installed, you can use a 32bit version of Windows to create 64bit\n",
    "extensions and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build for an alternate platform, specify the `!--plat-name` option to\n",
    "the build command. Valid values are currently 'win32', and 'win-amd64'.\n",
    "For example, on a 32bit version of Windows, you could execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python setup.py build --plat-name=win-amd64\n",
    "\n",
    "to build a 64bit version of your extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "would create a 64bit installation executable on your 32bit version of\n",
    "Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To cross-compile, you must download the Python source code and\n",
    "cross-compile Python itself for the platform you are targeting - it is\n",
    "not possible from a binary installation of Python (as the .lib etc file\n",
    "for other platforms are not included.) In practice, this means the user\n",
    "of a 32 bit operating system will need to use Visual Studio 2008 to open\n",
    "the `PCbuild/PCbuild.sln` solution in the Python source tree and build\n",
    "the \"x64\" configuration of the 'pythoncore' project before\n",
    "cross-compiling extensions is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that by default, Visual Studio 2008 does not install 64bit\n",
    "compilers or tools. You may need to reexecute the Visual Studio setup\n",
    "process and select these tools (using Control Panel-\\>\\[Add/Remove\\]\n",
    "Programs is a convenient way to check or modify your existing install.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Postinstallation script\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with Python 2.3, a postinstallation script can be specified\n",
    "with the `!--install-script` option. The basename of the script must be\n",
    "specified, and the script filename must also be listed in the scripts\n",
    "argument to the setup function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will be run at installation time on the target system after\n",
    "all the files have been copied, with `argv[1]` set to `!-install`, and\n",
    "again at uninstallation time before the files are removed with `argv[1]`\n",
    "set to `!-remove`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation script runs embedded in the windows installer, every\n",
    "output (`sys.stdout`, `sys.stderr`) is redirected into a buffer and will\n",
    "be displayed in the GUI after the script has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions especially useful in this context are available as\n",
    "additional built-in functions in the installation script.\n",
    "\n",
    "directory_created(path) file_created(path)\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions should be called when a directory or file is created by\n",
    "the postinstall script at installation time. It will register *path*\n",
    "with the uninstaller, so that it will be removed when the distribution\n",
    "is uninstalled. To be safe, directories are only removed if they are\n",
    "empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "get_special_folder_path(csidl_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function can be used to retrieve special folder locations on\n",
    "Windows like the Start Menu or the Desktop. It returns the full path to\n",
    "the folder. *csidl_string* must be one of the following strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"CSIDL_APPDATA\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"CSIDL_COMMON_STARTMENU\"\n",
    "    \"CSIDL_STARTMENU\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"CSIDL_COMMON_DESKTOPDIRECTORY\"\n",
    "    \"CSIDL_DESKTOPDIRECTORY\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"CSIDL_COMMON_STARTUP\"\n",
    "    \"CSIDL_STARTUP\"\n",

    "    \"CSIDL_PROGRAMS\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"CSIDL_FONTS\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If the folder cannot be retrieved, `OSError` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which folders are available depends on the exact Windows version, and\n",
    "probably also the configuration. For details refer to Microsoft's\n",
    "documentation of the :c`SHGetSpecialFolderPath` function.\n",

    "create_shortcut(target, description, filename\\[, arguments\\[, workdir\\[,\n",
