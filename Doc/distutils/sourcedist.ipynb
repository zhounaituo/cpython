    "Sometimes this is enough, but usually you will want to specify\n",
    "additional files to distribute. The typical way to do this is to write a\n",
    "*manifest template*, called `MANIFEST.in` by default. The manifest\n",
    "template is just a list of instructions for how to generate your\n",
    "manifest file, `MANIFEST`, which is the exact list of files to include\n",
    "in your source distribution. The `sdist` command processes this template\n",
    "and generates a manifest based on its instructions and what it finds in\n",
    "the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to roll your own manifest file, the format is simple: one\n",
    "filename per line, regular files (or symlinks to them) only. If you do\n",
    "supply your own `MANIFEST`, you must specify everything: the default set\n",
    "of files described above does not apply in this case.\n",
    "\n",

    "comparing its modification time to the one of `MANIFEST.in` or\n",
    "`setup.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1.3 `MANIFEST` files start with a comment indicating they are\n",
    "generated. Files without this comment are not overwritten or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2.2 `sdist` will read a `MANIFEST` file if no `MANIFEST.in` exists,\n",
    "like it used to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.7 `README.rst` is now included in the list of distutils standard\n",
    "READMEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manifest template has one command per line, where each command\n",
    "specifies a set of files to include or exclude from the source\n",
    "distribution. For an example, again we turn to the Distutils' own\n",
    "manifest template:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` none\n",
    "include *.txt\n",
    "recursive-include examples *.txt *.py\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The meanings should be fairly clear: include all files in the\n",
    "distribution root matching `\\*.txt`, all files anywhere under the\n",
    "`examples` directory matching `\\*.txt` or `\\*.py`, and exclude all\n",
    "directories matching `examples/sample?/build`. All of this is done\n",
    "*after* the standard include set, so you can exclude files from the\n",
    "standard set with explicit instructions in the manifest template. (Or,\n",
    "you can use the `!--no-defaults` option to disable the standard set\n",
    "entirely.) There are several other commands available in the manifest\n",
    "template mini-language; see section `sdist-cmd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of commands in the manifest template matters: initially, we\n",
    "have the list of default files as described above, and each command in\n",
    "the template adds to or removes from that list of files. Once we have\n",
    "fully processed the manifest template, we remove files that should not\n",

    "\n",
    "-   all files in the Distutils \"build\" tree (default `build/`)\n",
    "-   all files in directories named `RCS`, `CVS`, `.svn`, `.hg`, `.git`,\n",
    "    `.bzr` or `_darcs`\n",
    "\n",

    "for future reference, and then used to build the source distribution\n",
    "archive(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can disable the default set of included files with the\n",

    "2.  include `README.txt`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg` (standard files)\n",
    "3.  include `test/test\\*.py` (standard files)\n",
    "4.  include `\\*.txt` in the distribution root (this will find\n",
    "    `README.txt` a second time, but such redundancies are weeded out\n",
    "    later)\n",
    "5.  include anything matching `\\*.txt` or `\\*.py` in the sub-tree under\n",
    "    `examples`,\n",
    "6.  exclude all files in the sub-trees starting at directories matching\n",
    "    `examples/sample?/build`---this may exclude files included by the\n",
    "    previous two steps, so it's important that the `prune` command in\n",
    "    the manifest template comes after the `recursive-include` command\n",

    "\n",
    "Just like in the setup script, file and directory names in the manifest\n",
    "template should always be slash-separated; the Distutils will take care\n",

    "    `MANIFEST.in`, then it is used as is, unaltered\n",
    "-   if the manifest file doesn't exist or has been previously\n",
