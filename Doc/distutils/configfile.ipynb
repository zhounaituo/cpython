    "This document is being retained solely until the `setuptools`\n",
    "documentation at\n",

    "independently covers all of the relevant information currently included\n",
    "here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, it's not possible to write down everything needed to build a\n",
    "distribution *a priori*: you may need to get some information from the\n",
    "user, or from the user's system, in order to proceed. As long as that\n",
    "information is fairly simple---a list of directories to search for C\n",
    "header files or libraries, for example---then providing a configuration\n",
    "file, `setup.cfg`, for users to edit is a cheap and easy way to solicit\n",
    "it. Configuration files also let you provide default values for any\n",
    "command option, which the installer can then override either on the\n",
    "command-line or by editing the config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup configuration file is a useful middle-ground between the setup\n",
    "script---which, ideally, would be opaque to installers[1]---and the\n",
    "command-line to the setup script, which is outside of your control and\n",
    "entirely up to the installer. In fact, `setup.cfg` (and any other\n",
    "Distutils configuration files present on the target system) are\n",
    "processed after the contents of the setup script, but before the\n",
    "command-line. This has several useful consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   installers can override some of what you put in `setup.py` by\n",
    "    editing `setup.cfg`\n",
    "-   you can provide non-standard defaults for options that are not\n",
    "    easily set in `setup.py`\n",
    "-   installers can override anything in `setup.cfg` using the\n",
    "    command-line options to `setup.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the configuration file is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ini\n",
    "[command]\n",
    "option=value\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where *command* is one of the Distutils commands (e.g. `build_py`,\n",
    "`install`), and *option* is one of the options that command supports.\n",
    "Any number of options can be supplied for each command, and any number\n",
    "of command sections can be included in the file. Blank lines are\n",
    "ignored, as are comments, which run from a `'#'` character until the end\n",
    "of the line. Long option values can be split across multiple lines\n",
    "simply by indenting the continuation lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find out the list of options supported by a particular command\n",
    "with the universal `!--help` option, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell-session\n",
    "$ python setup.py --help build_ext\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "Options for 'build_ext' command:\n",
    "  --build-lib (-b)     directory for compiled extension modules\n",
    "  --build-temp (-t)    directory for temporary files (build by-products)\n",
    "  --inplace (-i)       ignore build-lib and put compiled extensions into the\n",
    "                       source directory alongside your pure Python modules\n",
    "  --include-dirs (-I)  list of directories to search for header files\n",
    "  --define (-D)        C preprocessor macros to define\n",
    "  --undef (-U)         C preprocessor macros to undefine\n",
    "  --swig-opts          list of SWIG command line options\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an option spelled `!--foo-bar` on the command-line is spelled\n",
    "`foo_bar` in configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want your extensions to be built \"in-place\"---that\n",
    "is, you have an extension `pkg.ext`, and you want the compiled extension\n",
    "file (`ext.so` on Unix, say) to be put in the same source directory as\n",
    "your pure Python modules `pkg.mod1` and `pkg.mod2`. You can always use\n",
    "the `!--inplace` option on the command-line to ensure this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sh\n",
    "python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this requires that you always specify the `build_ext` command\n",
    "explicitly, and remember to provide `!--inplace`. An easier way is to\n",
    "\"set and forget\" this option, by encoding it in `setup.cfg`, the\n",
    "configuration file for this distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ini\n",
    "[build_ext]\n",
    "inplace=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will affect all builds of this module distribution, whether or not\n",
    "you explicitly specify `build_ext`. If you include `setup.cfg` in your\n",
    "source distribution, it will also affect end-user builds---which is\n",
    "probably a bad idea for this option, since always building extensions\n",
    "in-place would break installation of the module distribution. In certain\n",
    "peculiar cases, though, modules are built right in their installation\n",
    "directory, so this is conceivably a useful ability. (Distributing\n",
    "extensions that expect to be built in their installation directory is\n",
    "almost always a bad idea, though.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example: certain commands take a lot of options that don't\n",
    "change from run to run; for example, `bdist_rpm` needs to know\n",
    "everything required to generate a \"spec\" file for creating an RPM\n",
    "distribution. Some of this information comes from the setup script, and\n",
    "some is automatically generated by the Distutils (such as the list of\n",
    "files installed). But some of it has to be supplied as options to\n",
    "`bdist_rpm`, which would be very tedious to do on the command-line for\n",
    "every run. Hence, here is a snippet from the Distutils' own `setup.cfg`:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ini\n",
    "[bdist_rpm]\n",

    "split across multiple lines for readability.\n",
