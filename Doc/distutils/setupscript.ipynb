    "# Writing the Setup Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is being retained solely until the `setuptools`\n",
    "documentation at\n",
    "<https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html>\n",
    "independently covers all of the relevant information currently included\n",
    "here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup script is the centre of all activity in building,\n",
    "distributing, and installing modules using the Distutils. The main\n",
    "purpose of the setup script is to describe your module distribution to\n",
    "the Distutils, so that the various commands that operate on your modules\n",
    "do the right thing. As we saw in section `distutils-simple-example`\n",
    "above, the setup script consists mainly of a call to `setup`, and most\n",
    "information supplied to the Distutils by the module developer is\n",
    "supplied as keyword arguments to `setup`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a slightly more involved example, which we'll follow for the next\n",
    "couple of sections: the Distutils' own setup script. (Keep in mind that\n",
    "although the Distutils are included with Python 1.6 and later, they also\n",
    "have an independent existence so that Python 1.5.2 users can use them to\n",
    "install other module distributions. The Distutils' own setup script,\n",
    "shown here, is used to install the package into Python 1.5.2.) :\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "\n",
    "    from distutils.core import setup\n",
    "\n",
    "    setup(name='Distutils',\n",
    "          version='1.0',\n",
    "          description='Python Distribution Utilities',\n",
    "          author='Greg Ward',\n",
    "          author_email='gward@python.net',\n",
    "          url='https://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/',\n",
    "          packages=['distutils', 'distutils.command'],\n",
    "         )\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two differences between this and the trivial one-file\n",
    "distribution presented in section `distutils-simple-example`: more\n",
    "metadata, and the specification of pure Python modules by package,\n",
    "rather than by module. This is important since the Distutils consist of\n",
    "a couple of dozen modules split into (so far) two packages; an explicit\n",
    "list of every module would be tedious to generate and difficult to\n",
    "maintain. For more information on the additional meta-data, see section\n",
    "`meta-data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that any pathnames (files or directories) supplied in the setup\n",
    "script should be written using the Unix convention, i.e.\n",
    "slash-separated. The Distutils will take care of converting this\n",
    "platform-neutral representation into whatever is appropriate on your\n",
    "current platform before actually using the pathname. This makes your\n",
    "setup script portable across operating systems, which of course is one\n",
    "of the major goals of the Distutils. In this spirit, all pathnames in\n",
    "this document are slash-separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, of course, only applies to pathnames given to Distutils functions.\n",
    "If you, for example, use standard Python functions such as `glob.glob`\n",
    "or `os.listdir` to specify files, you should be careful to write\n",
    "portable code instead of hardcoding path separators:\n",
    "\n",
    "    glob.glob(os.path.join('mydir', 'subdir', '*.html'))\n",
    "    os.listdir(os.path.join('mydir', 'subdir'))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Listing whole packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The `packages` option tells the Distutils to process (build, distribute,\n",
    "install, etc.) all pure Python modules found in each package mentioned\n",
    "in the `packages` list. In order to do this, of course, there has to be\n",
    "a correspondence between package names and directories in the\n",
    "filesystem. The default correspondence is the most obvious one, i.e.\n",
    "package `distutils` is found in the directory `distutils` relative to\n",
    "the distribution root. Thus, when you say `packages = ['foo']` in your\n",
    "setup script, you are promising that the Distutils will find a file\n",
    "`foo/__init__.py` (which might be spelled differently on your system,\n",
    "but you get the idea) relative to the directory where your setup script\n",
    "lives. If you break this promise, the Distutils will issue a warning but\n",
    "still process the broken package anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a different convention to lay out your source directory,\n",
    "that's no problem: you just have to supply the `package_dir` option to\n",
    "tell the Distutils about your convention. For example, say you keep all\n",
    "Python source under `lib`, so that modules in the \"root package\" (i.e.,\n",
    "not in any package at all) are in `lib`, modules in the `foo` package\n",
    "are in `lib/foo`, and so forth. Then you would put :\n",
    "\n",
    "    package_dir = {'': 'lib'}\n",
    "\n",
    "in your setup script. The keys to this dictionary are package names, and\n",
    "an empty package name stands for the root package. The values are\n",
    "directory names relative to your distribution root. In this case, when\n",
    "you say `packages = ['foo']`, you are promising that the file\n",
    "`lib/foo/__init__.py` exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible convention is to put the `foo` package right in `lib`,\n",
    "the `foo.bar` package in `lib/bar`, etc. This would be written in the\n",
    "setup script as :\n",
    "\n",
    "    package_dir = {'foo': 'lib'}\n",
    "\n",
    "A `package: dir` entry in the `package_dir` dictionary implicitly\n",
    "applies to all packages below *package*, so the `foo.bar` case is\n",
    "automatically handled here. In this example, having\n",
    "`packages = ['foo', 'foo.bar']` tells the Distutils to look for\n",
    "`lib/__init__.py` and `lib/bar/__init__.py`. (Keep in mind that although\n",
    "`package_dir` applies recursively, you must explicitly list all packages\n",
    "in `packages`: the Distutils will *not* recursively scan your source\n",
    "tree looking for any directory with an `__init__.py` file.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Listing individual modules\n",
    "\n",
    "For a small module distribution, you might prefer to list all modules\n",
    "rather than listing packages---especially the case of a single module\n",
    "that goes in the \"root package\" (i.e., no package at all). This simplest\n",
    "case was shown in section `distutils-simple-example`; here is a slightly\n",
    "more involved example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    py_modules = ['mod1', 'pkg.mod2']\n",
    "\n",
    "This describes two modules, one of them in the \"root\" package, the other\n",
    "in the `pkg` package. Again, the default package/directory layout\n",
    "implies that these two modules can be found in `mod1.py` and\n",
    "`pkg/mod2.py`, and that `pkg/__init__.py` exists as well. And again, you\n",
    "can override the package/directory correspondence using the\n",
    "`package_dir` option.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describing extension modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as writing Python extension modules is a bit more complicated than\n",
    "writing pure Python modules, describing them to the Distutils is a bit\n",
    "more complicated. Unlike pure modules, it's not enough just to list\n",
    "modules or packages and expect the Distutils to go out and find the\n",
    "right files; you have to specify the extension name, source file(s), and\n",
    "any compile/link requirements (include directories, libraries to link\n",
    "with, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is done through another keyword argument to `setup`, the\n",
    "`ext_modules` option. `ext_modules` is just a list of\n",
    "`~distutils.core.Extension` instances, each of which describes a single\n",
    "extension module. Suppose your distribution includes a single extension,\n",
    "called `foo` and implemented by `foo.c`. If no additional instructions\n",
    "to the compiler/linker are needed, describing this extension is quite\n",
    "simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extension('foo', ['foo.c'])\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Extension` class can be imported from `distutils.core` along with\n",
    "`setup`. Thus, the setup script for a module distribution that contains\n",
    "only this one extension and nothing else might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from distutils.core import setup, Extension\n",
    "    setup(name='foo',\n",
    "          version='1.0',\n",
    "          ext_modules=[Extension('foo', ['foo.c'])],\n",
    "          )\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Extension` class (actually, the underlying extension-building\n",
    "machinery implemented by the `build_ext` command) supports a great deal\n",
    "of flexibility in describing Python extensions, which is explained in\n",
    "the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extension names and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument to the `~distutils.core.Extension` constructor is\n",
    "always the name of the extension, including any package names. For\n",
    "example, :\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extension('foo', ['src/foo1.c', 'src/foo2.c'])\n",
    "\n",
    "describes an extension that lives in the root package, while :\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extension('pkg.foo', ['src/foo1.c', 'src/foo2.c'])\n",
    "\n",
    "describes the same extension in the `pkg` package. The source files and\n",
    "resulting object code are identical in both cases; the only difference\n",
    "is where in the filesystem (and therefore where in Python's namespace\n",
    "hierarchy) the resulting extension lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a number of extensions all in the same package (or all under\n",
    "the same base package), use the `ext_package` keyword argument to\n",
    "`setup`. For example, :\n",
    "\n",
    "    setup(...,\n",
    "          ext_package='pkg',\n",
    "          ext_modules=[Extension('foo', ['foo.c']),\n",
    "                       Extension('subpkg.bar', ['bar.c'])],\n",
    "         )\n",
    "\n",
    "will compile `foo.c` to the extension `pkg.foo`, and `bar.c` to\n",
    "`pkg.subpkg.bar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extension source files\n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument to the `~distutils.core.Extension` constructor is a\n",
    "list of source files. Since the Distutils currently only support C, C++,\n",
    "and Objective-C extensions, these are normally C/C++/Objective-C source\n",
    "files. (Be sure to use appropriate extensions to distinguish C++ source\n",
    "files: `.cc` and `.cpp` seem to be recognized by both Unix and Windows\n",
    "compilers.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can also include SWIG interface (`.i`) files in the list;\n",
    "the `build_ext` command knows how to deal with SWIG extensions: it will\n",
    "run SWIG on the interface file and compile the resulting C/C++ file into\n",
    "your extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "This warning notwithstanding, options to SWIG can be currently passed\n",
    "like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    setup(...,\n",
    "          ext_modules=[Extension('_foo', ['foo.i'],\n",
    "                                 swig_opts=['-modern', '-I../include'])],\n",
    "          py_modules=['foo'],\n",
    "         )\n",
    "\n",
    "Or on the commandline like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    > python setup.py build_ext --swig-opts=\"-modern -I../include\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On some platforms, you can include non-source files that are processed\n",
    "by the compiler and included in your extension. Currently, this just\n",
    "means Windows message text (`.mc`) files and resource definition (`.rc`)\n",
    "files for Visual C++. These will be compiled to binary resource (`.res`)\n",
    "files and linked into the executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessor options\n",
    "\n",
    "Three optional arguments to `~distutils.core.Extension` will help if you\n",
    "need to specify include directories to search or preprocessor macros to\n",
    "define/undefine: `include_dirs`, `define_macros`, and `undef_macros`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your extension requires header files in the `include`\n",
    "directory under your distribution root, use the `include_dirs` option:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extension('foo', ['foo.c'], include_dirs=['include'])\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify absolute directories there; if you know that your\n",
    "extension will only be built on Unix systems with X11R6 installed to\n",
    "`/usr`, you can get away with :\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extension('foo', ['foo.c'], include_dirs=['/usr/include/X11'])\n",
    "\n",
    "You should avoid this sort of non-portable usage if you plan to\n",
    "distribute your code: it's probably better to write C code like :\n",
    "\n",
    "    #include <X11/Xlib.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to include header files from some other Python extension,\n",
    "you can take advantage of the fact that header files are installed in a\n",
    "consistent way by the Distutils `install_headers` command. For example,\n",
    "the Numerical Python header files are installed (on a standard Unix\n",
    "installation) to `/usr/local/include/python1.5/Numerical`. (The exact\n",
    "location will differ according to your platform and Python\n",
    "installation.) Since the Python include\n",
    "directory---`/usr/local/include/python1.5` in this case---is always\n",
    "included in the search path when building Python extensions, the best\n",
    "approach is to write C code like :\n",
    "\n",
    "    #include <Numerical/arrayobject.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you must put the `Numerical` include directory right into your header\n",
    "search path, though, you can find that directory using the Distutils\n",
    "`distutils.sysconfig` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_inc\n",
    "    incdir = os.path.join(get_python_inc(plat_specific=1), 'Numerical')\n",
    "    setup(...,\n",
    "          Extension(..., include_dirs=[incdir]),\n",
    "          )\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this is quite portable---it will work on any Python\n",
    "installation, regardless of platform---it's probably easier to just\n",
    "write your C code in the sensible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define and undefine pre-processor macros with the\n",
    "`define_macros` and `undef_macros` options. `define_macros` takes a list\n",
    "of `(name, value)` tuples, where `name` is the name of the macro to\n",
    "define (a string) and `value` is its value: either a string or `None`.\n",
    "(Defining a macro `FOO` to `None` is the equivalent of a bare\n",
    "`#define FOO` in your C source: with most compilers, this sets `FOO` to\n",
    "the string `1`.) `undef_macros` is just a list of macros to undefine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extension(...,\n",
    "              define_macros=[('NDEBUG', '1'),\n",
    "                             ('HAVE_STRFTIME', None)],\n",
    "              undef_macros=['HAVE_FOO', 'HAVE_BAR'])\n",
    "\n",
    "is the equivalent of having this at the top of every C source file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #define NDEBUG 1\n",
    "    #define HAVE_STRFTIME\n",
    "    #undef HAVE_FOO\n",
    "    #undef HAVE_BAR\n",
    "\n",
    "### Library options\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify the libraries to link against when building your\n",
    "extension, and the directories to search for those libraries. The\n",
    "`libraries` option is a list of libraries to link against,\n",
    "`library_dirs` is a list of directories to search for libraries at\n",
    "link-time, and `runtime_library_dirs` is a list of directories to search\n",
    "for shared (dynamically loaded) libraries at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you need to link against libraries known to be in the\n",
    "standard library search path on target systems :\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extension(...,\n",
    "              libraries=['gdbm', 'readline'])\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to link with libraries in a non-standard location, you'll\n",
    "have to include the location in `library_dirs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extension(...,\n",
    "              library_dirs=['/usr/X11R6/lib'],\n",
    "              libraries=['X11', 'Xt'])\n",
    "\n",
    "(Again, this sort of non-portable construct should be avoided if you\n",
    "intend to distribute your code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other options\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still some other options which can be used to handle special\n",
    "cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `optional` option is a boolean; if it is true, a build failure in\n",
    "the extension will not abort the build process, but instead simply not\n",
    "install the failing extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `extra_objects` option is a list of object files to be passed to the\n",
    "linker. These files must not have extensions, as the default extension\n",
    "for the compiler is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "`extra_compile_args` and `extra_link_args` can be used to specify\n",
    "additional command line options for the respective compiler and linker\n",
    "command lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "`export_symbols` is only useful on Windows. It can contain a list of\n",
    "symbols (functions or variables) to be exported. This option is not\n",
    "needed when building compiled extensions: Distutils will automatically\n",
    "add `initmodule` to the list of exported symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `depends` option is a list of files that the extension depends on\n",
    "(for example header files). The build command will call the compiler on\n",
    "the sources to rebuild extension if any on this files has been modified\n",
    "since the previous build.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationships between Distributions and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "A distribution may relate to packages in three specific ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It can require packages or modules.\n",
    "2.  It can provide packages or modules.\n",
    "3.  It can obsolete packages or modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships can be specified using keyword arguments to the\n",
    "`distutils.core.setup` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies on other Python modules and packages can be specified by\n",
    "supplying the *requires* keyword argument to `setup`. The value must be\n",
    "a list of strings. Each string specifies a package that is required, and\n",
    "optionally what versions are sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify that any version of a module or package is required, the\n",
    "string should consist entirely of the module or package name. Examples\n",
    "include `'mymodule'` and `'xml.parsers.expat'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If specific versions are required, a sequence of qualifiers can be\n",
    "supplied in parentheses. Each qualifier may consist of a comparison\n",
    "operator and a version number. The accepted comparison operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <    >    ==\n",
    "    <=   >=   !=\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be combined by using multiple qualifiers separated by commas\n",
    "(and optional whitespace). In this case, all of the qualifiers must be\n",
    "matched; a logical AND is used to combine the evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a bunch of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Requires Expression   | Explanation                                                            |\n",
    "|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `==1.0`               | Only version `1.0` is compatible                                       |\n",
    "| `>1.0, !=1.5.1, <2.0` | Any version after `1.0` and before `2.0` is compatible, except `1.5.1` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can specify dependencies, we also need to be able to specify\n",
    "what we provide that other distributions can require. This is done using\n",
    "the *provides* keyword argument to `setup`. The value for this keyword\n",
    "is a list of strings, each of which names a Python module or package,\n",
    "and optionally identifies the version. If the version is not specified,\n",
    "it is assumed to match that of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Provides Expression | Explanation                                                         |\n",
    "|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `mypkg`             | Provide `mypkg`, using the distribution version                     |\n",
    "| `mypkg (1.1)`       | Provide `mypkg` version 1.1, regardless of the distribution version |\n",
    "\n",
    "A package can declare that it obsoletes other packages using the\n",
    "*obsoletes* keyword argument. The value for this is similar to that of\n",
    "the *requires* keyword: a list of strings giving module or package\n",
    "specifiers. Each specifier consists of a module or package name\n",
    "optionally followed by one or more version qualifiers. Version\n",
    "qualifiers are given in parentheses after the module or package name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The versions identified by the qualifiers are those that are obsoleted\n",
    "by the distribution being described. If no qualifiers are given, all\n",
    "versions of the named module or package are understood to be obsoleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been dealing with pure and non-pure Python modules, which\n",
    "are usually not run by themselves but imported by scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts are files containing Python source code, intended to be started\n",
    "from the command line. Scripts don't require Distutils to do anything\n",
    "very complicated. The only clever feature is that if the first line of\n",

    "\n",

    "are often data that's closely related to the package's implementation,\n",
    "or text files containing documentation that might be of interest to\n",

    "\n",
    "Package data can be added to packages using the `package_data` keyword\n",
    "argument to the `setup` function. The value must be a mapping from\n",
    "package name to a list of relative path names that should be copied into\n",
    "the package. The paths are interpreted as relative to the directory\n",
    "containing the package (information from the `package_dir` mapping is\n",
    "used if appropriate); that is, the files are expected to be part of the\n",

    "\n",
    "The path names may contain directory portions; any necessary directories\n",
