    "## Pure Python distribution (by module)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're just distributing a couple of modules, especially if they\n",
    "don't live in a particular package, you can specify them individually\n",
    "using the `py_modules` option in the setup script.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, you'll have two files to worry about: a setup\n",
    "script and the single module you're distributing, `foo.py` in this\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <root>/\n",
    "            setup.py\n",
    "            foo.py\n",
    "\n",
    "(In all diagrams in this section, *\\<root\\>* will refer to the\n",
    "distribution root directory.) A minimal setup script to describe this\n",
    "situation would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from distutils.core import setup\n",
    "    setup(name='foo',\n",
    "          version='1.0',\n",
    "          py_modules=['foo'],\n",
    "          )\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the name of the distribution is specified independently with\n",
    "the `name` option, and there's no rule that says it has to be the same\n",
    "as the name of the sole module in the distribution (although that's\n",
    "probably a good convention to follow). However, the distribution name is\n",
    "used to generate filenames, so you should stick to letters, digits,\n",
    "underscores, and hyphens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `py_modules` is a list, you can of course specify multiple\n",
    "modules, eg. if you're distributing modules `foo` and `bar`, your setup\n",
    "might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <root>/\n",
    "            setup.py\n",
    "            foo.py\n",
    "            bar.py\n",
    "\n",
    "and the setup script might be :\n",
    "\n",
    "    from distutils.core import setup\n",
    "    setup(name='foobar',\n",
    "          version='1.0',\n",
    "          py_modules=['foo', 'bar'],\n",
    "          )\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put module source files into another directory, but if you have\n",
    "enough modules to do that, it's probably easier to specify modules by\n",
    "package rather than listing them individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pure Python distribution (by package)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have more than a couple of modules to distribute, especially if\n",
    "they are in multiple packages, it's probably easier to specify whole\n",
    "packages rather than individual modules. This works even if your modules\n",
    "are not in a package; you can just tell the Distutils to process modules\n",
    "from the root package, and that works the same as any other package\n",
    "(except that you don't have to have an `__init__.py` file).\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup script from the last example could also be written as :\n",
    "\n",
    "    from distutils.core import setup\n",
    "    setup(name='foobar',\n",
    "          version='1.0',\n",
    "          packages=[''],\n",
    "          )\n",
    "\n",
    "(The empty string stands for the root package.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If those two files are moved into a subdirectory, but remain in the root\n",
    "package, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <root>/\n",
    "            setup.py\n",
    "            src/      foo.py\n",
    "                      bar.py\n",
    "\n",
    "then you would still specify the root package, but you have to tell the\n",
    "Distutils where source files in the root package live:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from distutils.core import setup\n",
    "    setup(name='foobar',\n",
    "          version='1.0',\n",
    "          package_dir={'': 'src'},\n",
    "          packages=[''],\n",
    "          )\n",
    "\n",
    "More typically, though, you will want to distribute multiple modules in\n",
    "the same package (or in sub-packages). For example, if the `foo` and\n",
    "`bar` modules belong in package `foobar`, one way to layout your source\n",
    "tree is :\n",
    "\n",
    "    <root>/\n",
    "            setup.py\n",
    "            foobar/\n",
    "                     __init__.py\n",
    "                     foo.py\n",
    "                     bar.py\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in fact the default layout expected by the Distutils, and the\n",
    "one that requires the least work to describe in your setup script:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from distutils.core import setup\n",
    "    setup(name='foobar',\n",
    "          version='1.0',\n",
    "          packages=['foobar'],\n",
    "          )\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to put modules in directories not named for their package,\n",
    "then you need to use the `package_dir` option again. For example, if the\n",
    "`src` directory holds modules in the `foobar` package:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <root>/\n",
    "            setup.py\n",
    "            src/\n",

    "Extension modules are specified using the `ext_modules` option.\n",
    "`package_dir` has no effect on where extension source files are found;\n",

    "\n",
    "If the extension actually belongs in a package, say `foopkg`, then\n",
    "\n",
    "With exactly the same source tree layout, this extension can be put in\n",

    "## Checking a package\n",
    "\n",
    "The `check` command allows you to verify if your package meta-data meet\n",
    "the minimum requirements to build a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run it, just call it using your `setup.py` script. If something is\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the reStructuredText syntax in the `long_description` field\n",
    "and [docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net) is installed you can\n",
    "check if the syntax is fine with the `check` command, using the\n",
    "`restructuredtext` option.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the `setup.py` script is changed like this:\n",

    "        url='http://example.com', long_description=desc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the long description is broken, `check` will be able to detect it\n",

    "## Reading the metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "The `distutils.core.setup` function provides a command-line interface\n",

    "``` shell-session\n",
    "$ python setup.py --name\n",

    "\n",
    "This call reads the `name` metadata by running the\n",
    "`distutils.core.setup` function. Although, when a source or binary\n",
    "distribution is created with Distutils, the metadata fields are written\n",
    "in a static file called `PKG-INFO`. When a Distutils-based project is\n",
    "installed in Python, the `PKG-INFO` file is copied alongside the modules\n",
    "and packages of the distribution under `NAME-VERSION-pyX.X.egg-info`,\n",
    "where `NAME` is the name of the project, `VERSION` its version as\n",
