    "Please read the [devguide](https://devguide.python.org/) for guidance on\n",
    "how to contribute to this project. The documentation covers everything\n",
    "from how to build the code to submitting a pull request. There are also\n",

    "\n",
    "Please be aware that our workflow does deviate slightly from the typical\n",

    "covered in [Lifecycle of a Pull\n",
    "Request](https://devguide.python.org/pullrequest/). We utilize various\n",
    "bots and status checks to help with this, so do follow the comments they\n",
    "leave and their \"Details\" links, respectively. The key points of our\n",

    "    documentation changes), feel free to add yourself to `Misc/ACKS`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that this project is entirely volunteer-run (i.e. no one\n",
    "is paid to work on Python full-time), we unfortunately can make no\n",
    "guarantees as to if or when a core developer will get around to\n",
    "reviewing your pull request. If no core developer has done a review or\n",
    "responded to changes made because of a \"changes requested\" review,\n",

    "\n",
    "All interactions for this project are covered by the [PSF Code of\n",
    "Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/). Everyone is\n",
    "expected to be open, considerate, and respectful of others no matter\n",
    "their position within the project."
